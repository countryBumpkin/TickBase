"['In an effort to determine exposure to ticks and to determine appropriate preventative measures to reduce the occurrence of Lyme Disease in summer research interns at Harvard Forest, data are collected about where students work at Harvard Forest; the time spent in the field; the number of ticks students find on themselves after each trip to the field; and the number of ticks that actually bite and embed themselves in the skin. From these data, we estimate areas of high tick densities and estimate time of summer during which ticks are most prevalent. The results are used to develop recommendations for appropriate precautions that students can take to avoid tick-borne diseases.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/22536ed700a7330153d826474d0c6873'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Incidence of Ticks and Tick Bites at Harvard Forest since 2006']
"['Wind data have been measured by an anemometer mounted 3\n      m above the ground at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\n      Headquarters since 1965. Prior to 1981, every mile of wind\n      movement caused a tick mark on a strip-chart recorder, and\n      wind direction as N, S, E, W, or a combination, was recorded\n      continuously. Since 1981, wind speed and direction have been\n      collected by an automatic data logger system. In 2004, a R.M.\n      Young company wind speed direction sensor (model 05103) was\n      installed. Since that time wind direction (azimuth) are based\n      on a 0 to 360 degree scale.\n      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook\n      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at\n      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and\n      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research\n      Station.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/b9a061361edd036a7f988aa83c557e83'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USDA Forest Service):\n    Wind Speed and Wind Direction Measurements, 1965 -\n    present']"

"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands.

Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"

We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.

"[""Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019\n  Understanding factors that influence a species' distribution and abundance across the annual cycle is required for range-wide conservation. Thousands of imperiled red knots (Calidris cantus rufa) stop on Virginia's barrier islands each year to replenish fat during spring migration. We investigated the variation in red knot presence and flock size, the effects of prey on this variation, and factors influencing prey abundance on Virginia's barrier islands. We counted red knots and collected potential prey samples at randomly selected sites from 2007 - 2018 during a two-week period during early and peak migration. Core samples contained crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), coquina clams (Donax variabilis), and miscellaneous prey (horseshoe crab eggs (Limulus polyphemus), angel wing clams (Cyrtopleura costata), and other organisms (e.g., insect larvae, snails, worms)). Estimated red knot numbers in Virginia during peak migration were highest in 2012 (11,959) and lowest in 2014 (2,857; 12-year peak migration xÌ„ = 7,175, SD = 2,869). Red knot and prey numbers varied across sampling periods and substrates (i.e., peat and sand). Red knots generally used sites with more prey. Miscellaneous prey (xÌ„ = 18.85/core sample, SE = 0.88) influenced red knot presence at a site early in migration, when we only sampled on peat banks. Coquina clams (xÌ„ = 11/core sample, SE = 0.30) and blue mussels (xÌ„ = 0.94/core sample, SE = 0.04) affected red knot presence at a site during peak migration, when we sampled both substrates. Few relationships between prey and red knot flock size existed, suggesting that other unmeasured factors determined red knot numbers at occupied sites. Tide and mean daily water temperature affected prey abundance. Maximizing the diversity, availability, and abundance of prey for red knots on barrier islands requires management that encourages the presence of both sand and peat bank intertidal habitats.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/71f2afaf22ce0099b80afc70f824acdf'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019']"

Moths are sampled using blacklight traps deployed for one night every two weeks at each site from April through October.  A total of 503 species have been observed, and approximately 300 species may be observed in any given year. The watershed can be divided into 13 distinct zones. The northwest ridge above the Andrews headquarters has the highest number of species (n = 321) and the lowest number of species occurred at upper Lookout Creek (n = 239). Each of 13 zones is missing ca. 200 of the 500 resident species, suggesting that heterogeneity in the landscape is important. A breakdown of the species into functional groups based on larval feeding habits: conifers, hardwood, herb, mix, unknown shows that 43% of Andrews species rely on a hardwoods and 63% rely on hardwoods and herbaceous angiosperms.

Increased spread of\n  infectious disease is often cited as a potential negative effect of\n  habitat corridors used in conservation, but the impacts of corridors\n  on pathogen movement have never been tested empirically. Using sweet\n  corn (Zea mays) and southern corn leaf blight (Cochliobolus\n  heterostrophus) as a model plant-pathogen system, we tested the\n  impacts of connectivity and habitat fragmentation on pathogen movement\n  and disease development at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina,\n  USA. Over time, less edgy patches had higher proportions of diseased\n  plants, and distance of host plants to habitat edges was the greatest\n  determinant of disease development. Variation in average daytime\n  temperatures provided a possible mechanism for these disease patterns.\n  Our results show that worries over the potentially harmful effects of\n  conservation corridors on disease dynamics are misplaced, and that, in\n  a conservation context, many diseases can be better managed by\n  mitigating edge effects.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/f23a3be45f483d23bb09adead1fc5d53'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Edge effects, not connectivity, determine the incidence and development of a foliar fungal plant disease']"

"['This layer is a high-resolution tree canopy change-detection layer for Baltimore City, MD. It contains three tree-canopy classes for the period 2007-2015: (1) No Change; (2) Gain; and (3) Loss.

Tree canopy that existed during both time periods was assigned to the No Change category while trees removed by development, storms, or disease were assigned to the Loss class. Trees planted during the interval were assigned to the Gain category, as were the edges of existing trees that expanded noticeably. Direct comparison was possible because both the 2007 and 2015 maps were created using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and included similar source datasets (LiDAR-derived surface models, multispectral imagery, and thematic GIS inputs). OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.

"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands. Both Gunnisonâ€™s and black-tailed prairie dogs can increase the number of plant species in grasslands and landscape heterogeneity with their ecosystem engineering that creates disturbed patches on the landscape. Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"
"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are considered keystone species of grassland ecosystems, and co-occur in the arid grasslands of the southwestern United States and in Mexico. Their keystone status is attributed primarily to the effects of their burrowing and foraging behavior, but they differ ecologically in several important respects. We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.

"['This soil moisture study was initiated in 1960 to investigate the effects of patch clearcut logging and slash burning (1962-63) in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in the Oregon Cascade Range.  Since soil moisture and vegetation sampling continued regularly until 1980, this is a unique data set that represents nearly two decades of post-treatment information.\n      \nPlant cover exerts a profound influence on soil moisture levels through its effects on interception, infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration.  In the Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest, clearcut logging and slash burning are common practices that can dramatically alter plant cover and soil moisture.  Logging can increase soil moisture by temporarily reducing cover and associated water use, and burning may further augment soil moisture levels by suppressing the survival and regrowth of vegetation.  Indeed, part of the rationale for slash burning in the region is to control shrubs and other vegetation that would otherwise compete with conifer seedlings for available moisture, light, and nutrients.  Within a few years after burning, however, invading vegetation may deplete soil moisture to levels comparable to forested areas.  Such  observations point to the value of long-term information to better understand dynamic soil moisture and plant cover responses to forest practices.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/a56385be60eeb67ba0a8edbefa5f9e93'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Soil Moisture and  vegetation cover patterns after logging and burning an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in the Andrews Experimental Forest, 1960-1983']"
"[""The factors that contribute to plant species establishment and decline following disturbance determine the rates and patterns of successional change of a system. In this long-term field experiment, we test the commonly held assumption that competition for space or resources by dominant species determines the outcome of succession. Specifically, we examine the population- and community-level consequences of removing one or more potentially dominant species from the post-disturbance community after clearcut logging and burning of a mature/old-growth Douglas-fir forest. Experimental treatments include: (1) removal of early-seral annual, Senecio sylvaticus, or perennial, Epilobium angustifolium—or both—to test the influences of these early-seral dominants on subsequent community development; (2) removal of all species except Senecio or Epilobium, to test whether the decline of these early-seral dominants is driven by competitive displacement; or (3) removal of shade-tolerant forest species that dominate subsequent stages of succession—Rubus ursinus or Berberis nervosa plus Gaultheria shallon—to test the influences of these long-lived perennials on understory development. The experiment is a randomized block design comprising eight removal treatments plus a control replicated in each of 25 blocks. Removal (reduction in competition) is achieved by removing seedlings or vegetative stems annually from a treatment area of 2.5 x 2.5 m. Sample plots (1 x 1 m) centered within these are used to estimate cover of all vascular plant species and, for the first 8 yr of the experiment, stem density and height, facilitating estimates of above-ground biomass. Pre-harvest data were collected in 1990, logging/burning occurred in 1991, and removal treatments and post-treatment sampling were initiated in 1992. Six of the nine experimental treatments were terminated between 1996 and 1998, with loss of early-seral Senecio and Epilobium from the system. The remaining three treatments (removal of Rubus, removal of Berberis plus Gaultheria, and the control) have been sampled annually since 1992.  All regeneration of trees within the experimental area has occurred naturally. In September 2018, the study site partially burned during the larger Terwilliger Fire on the Willamette National Forest. In 2019, plots were assessed for burn severity. Species' removals were terminated, but cover measurements continue in the plots.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/4f23d0d998bc19db6ee68b767c8772bf'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Species interactions during succession in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, 1990 to present']"

Despite planting, most tree stems originated naturally, either as sprouts from cut stumps (hardwoods) or as natural regeneration (conifers and hardwoods).  Study plots were established and sampled for cover and frequency of understory vegetation and counts of seedlings and saplings prior to harvest (1973) and resampled annually for cover and biomass of understory vegetation and tree growth from 1976-1981, then in 1983, 1985, and then in 4-6 year intervals.

"[""Oil spills represent a major environmental threat to coastal wetlands, which provide a variety of critical ecosystem services to humanity. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is a hub of oil and gas exploration and production with recognized consequences on intertidal habitats, such as the salt marsh. Following the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we sampled the marine invertebrate and the terrestrial arthropod community found in stands of Spartina alterniflora, the most abundant plant in coastal salt marshes, in 2010 as oil was washing ashore and a year later in 2011. In 2010, intertidal crabs and terrestrial arthropods (insects and spiders) were suppressed by oil exposure even in seemingly unaffected stands of plants; however, Littoraria snails appeared unaffected. One year later, crab and arthropods appeared to have largely recovered. Our work is the first attempt that we know of assessing vulnerability of the salt marsh arthropod community to oil exposure, and it suggests that arthropods are both quite vulnerable to oil exposure, and quite resilient, able to recover from exposure within a year if host plants remain healthy. BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect variables that we were measuring in the area.

"['Site description.\n      \n      This data package consists of data obtained from sampling surface soil (the 0-7.6 cm depth profile) in black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forest and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) saltmarsh along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in peninsular west-central Florida, USA. This location has a subtropical climate with mean daily temperatures ranging from 15.4 °C in January to 27.8 °C in August, and annual precipitation of 1336 mm. Precipitation falls as rain primarily between June and September. Tides are semi-diurnal, with 0.57 m median amplitudes during the year preceding sampling (U.S. NOAA National Ocean Service, Clearwater Beach, Florida, station 8726724). Sea-level rise is 4.0 ± 0.6 mm per year (1973-2020 trend, mean ± 95 % confidence interval, NOAA NOS Clearwater Beach station). The A. germinans mangrove zone is either adjacent to water or fringed on the seaward side by a narrow band of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). A near-monoculture of J. roemerianus is often adjacent to and immediately landward of the A. germinans zone. The transition from the mangrove to the J. roemerianus zone is variable in our study area. An abrupt edge between closed-canopy mangrove and J. roemerianus monoculture may extend for up to several hundred meters in some locations, while other stretches of ecotone present a gradual transition where smaller, widely spaced trees are interspersed into the herbaceous marsh. Juncus roemerianus then extends landward to a high marsh patchwork of succulent halophytes (including Salicornia bigellovi, Sesuvium sp., and Batis maritima), scattered dwarf mangrove, and salt pans, followed in turn by upland vegetation that includes Pinus sp. and Serenoa repens.\n      \n      Field design and sample collection.\n      \n      We established three study sites spaced at approximately 5 km intervals along the western coastline of the central Florida peninsula. The sites consisted of the Salt Springs (28.3298°, -82.7274°), Energy Marine Center (28.2903°, -82.7278°), and Green Key (28.2530°, -82.7496°) sites on the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Pasco County, Florida, USA. At each site, we established three plot pairs, each consisting of one saltmarsh plot and one mangrove plot. Plots were 50 m^2 in size. Plots pairs within a site were separated by 230-1070 m, and the mangrove and saltmarsh plots composing a pair were 70-170 m apart. All plot pairs consisted of directly adjacent patches of mangrove forest and J. roemerianus saltmarsh, with the mangrove forests exhibiting a closed canopy and a tree architecture (height 4-6 m, crown width 1.5-3 m). Mangrove plots were located at approximately the midpoint between the seaward edge (water-mangrove interface) and landward edge (mangrove-marsh interface) of the mangrove zone. Saltmarsh plots were located 20-25 m away from any mangrove trees and into the J. roemerianus zone (i.e., landward from the mangrove-marsh interface). Plot pairs were coarsely similar in geomorphic setting, as all were located on the Gulf of Mexico coastline, rather than within major sheltering formations like Tampa Bay, and all plot pairs fit the tide-dominated domain of the Woodroffe classification (Woodroffe, 2002, ""Coasts: Form, Process and Evolution"", Cambridge University Press), given their conspicuous semi-diurnal tides. There was nevertheless some geomorphic variation, as some plot pairs were directly open to the Gulf of Mexico while others sat behind keys and spits or along small tidal creeks. Our use of a plot-pair approach is intended to control for this geomorphic variation. Plot center elevations (cm above mean sea level, NAVD 88) were estimated by overlaying the plot locations determined with a global positioning system (Garmin GPS 60, Olathe, KS, USA) on a LiDAR-derived bare-earth digital elevation model (Dewberry, Inc., 2019). The digital elevation model had a vertical accuracy of ± 10 cm (95 % CI) and a horizontal accuracy of ± 116 cm (95 % CI).\n      \n      Soil samples were collected via coring at low tide in June 2011. From each plot, we collected a composite soil sample consisting of three discrete 5.1 cm diameter soil cores taken at equidistant points to 7.6 cm depth. Cores were taken by tapping a sleeve into the soil until its top was flush with the soil surface, sliding a hand under the core, and lifting it up. Cores were then capped and transferred on ice to our laboratory at the University of South Florida (Tampa, Florida, USA), where they were combined in plastic zipper bags, and homogenized by hand into plot-level composite samples on the day they were collected. A damp soil subsample was immediately taken from each composite sample to initiate 1 y incubations for determination of active C and N (see below). The remainder of each composite sample was then placed in a drying oven (60 °C) for 1 week with frequent mixing of the soil to prevent aggregation and liberate water. Organic wetland soils are sometimes dried at 70 °C, however high drying temperatures can volatilize non-water liquids and oxidize and decompose organic matter, so 50 °C is also a common drying temperature for organic soils (Gardner 1986, ""Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 1"", Soil Science Society of America); we accordingly chose 60 °C as a compromise between sufficient water removal and avoidance of non-water mass loss. Bulk density was determined as soil dry mass per core volume (adding back the dry mass equivalent of the damp subsample removed prior to drying). Dried subsamples were obtained for determination of soil organic matter (SOM), mineral texture composition, and extractable and total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) within the following week.\n      \n      Sample analyses.\n      \n      A dried subsample was apportioned from each composite sample to determine SOM as mass loss on ignition at 550 °C for 4 h. After organic matter was removed from soil via ignition, mineral particle size composition was determined using a combination of wet sieving and density separation in 49 mM (3 %) sodium hexametaphosphate ((NaPO_3)_6) following procedures in Kettler et al. (2001, Soil Science Society of America Journal 65, 849-852). The percentage of dry soil mass composed of silt and clay particles (hereafter, fines) was calculated as the mass lost from dispersed mineral soil after sieving (0.053 mm mesh sieve). Fines could have been slightly underestimated if any clay particles were burned off during the preceding ignition of soil. An additional subsample was taken from each composite sample to determine extractable N and organic C concentrations via 0.5 M potassium sulfate (K_2SO_4) extractions. We combined soil and extractant (ratio of 1 g dry soil:5 mL extractant) in plastic bottles, reciprocally shook the slurry for 1 h at 120 rpm, and then gravity filtered it through Fisher G6 (1.6 μm pore size) glass fiber filters, followed by colorimetric detection of nitrite (NO_2^-) + nitrate (NO_3^-) and ammonium (NH_4^+) in the filtrate (Hood Nowotny et al., 2010,Soil Science Society of America Journal 74, 1018-1027) using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek Epoch, Winooski, VT, USA). Filtrate was also analyzed for dissolved organic C (referred to hereafter as extractable organic C) and total dissolved N via combustion and oxidation followed by detection of the evolved CO_2 and N oxide gases on a Formacs HT TOC/TN analyzer (Skalar, Breda, The Netherlands). Extractable organic N was then computed as total dissolved N in filtrate minus extractable mineral N (itself the sum of extractable NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N). We determined soil total C and N from dried, milled subsamples subjected to elemental analysis (ECS 4010, Costech, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) at the University of South Florida Stable Isotope Laboratory. Median concentration of inorganic C in unvegetated surface soil at our sites is 0.5 % of soil mass (Anderson, 2019, Univ. of South Florida M.S. thesis via methods in Wang et al., 2011, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment 174, 241-257). Inorganic C concentrations are likely even lower in our samples from under vegetation, where organic matter would dilute the contribution of inorganic C to soil mass. Nevertheless, the presence of a small inorganic C pool in our soils may be counted in the total C values we report. Extractable organic C is necessarily of organic C origin given the method (sparging with HCl) used in detection.\n      \n      Active C and N represent the fractions of organic C and N that are mineralizable by soil microorganisms under aerobic conditions in long-term soil incubations. To quantify active C and N, 60 g of field-moist soil were apportioned from each composite sample, placed in a filtration apparatus, and incubated in the dark at 25 °C and field capacity moisture for 365 d (as in Lewis et al., 2014, Ecosphere 5, art59). Moisture levels were maintained by frequently weighing incubated soil and wetting them up to target mass. Daily CO_2 flux was quantified on 29 occasions at 0.5-3 week intervals during the incubation period (with shorter intervals earlier in the incubation), and these per day flux rates were integrated over the 365 d period to compute an estimate of active C. Observations of per day flux were made by sealing samples overnight in airtight chambers fitted with septa and quantifying headspace CO_2 accumulation by injecting headspace samples (obtained through the septa via needle and syringe) into an infrared gas analyzer (PP Systems EGM 4, Amesbury, MA, USA). To estimate active N, each incubated sample was leached with a C  and N free, 35 psu solution containing micronutrients (Nadelhoffer, 1990, Soil Science Society of America Journal 54, 411-415) on 19 occasions at increasing 1-6 week intervals during the 365 d incubation, and then extracted in 0.5 M K_2SO_4 at the end of the incubation in order to remove any residual mineral N. Active N was then quantified as the total mass of mineral N leached and extracted. Mineral N in leached and extracted solutions was detected as NH_4-N and NO_2-N + NO_3-N via colorimetry as above. This incubation technique precludes new C and N inputs and persistently leaches mineral N, forcing microorganisms to meet demand by mineralizing existing pools, and thereby directly assays the potential activity of soil organic C and N pools present at the time of soil sampling. Because this analysis commences with disrupting soil physical structure, it is biased toward higher estimates of active fractions.\n      \n      Calculations.\n      \n      Non-mobile C and N fractions were computed as total C and N concentrations minus the extractable and active fractions of each element. This data package reports surface-soil constituents (moisture, fines, SOM, and C and N pools and fractions) in both gravimetric units (mass constituent / mass soil) and areal units (mass  constituent / soil surface area integrated through 7.6 cm soil depth, the depth of sampling). Areal concentrations were computed as X × D × 7.6, where X is the gravimetric concentration of a soil constituent, D is soil bulk density (g dry soil / cm^3), and 7.6 is the sampling depth in cm.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/0e08cbe07c84488cb7b9dd16669946d0'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Florida mangrove saltmarsh reference surface soils']

"[""Phenology is a key biological trait of an organism’s success and is one of the best indicators of its response to recent climate change. Plants are among the most well-studied organisms in this regard, but observational data bearing on this topic are largely restricted to woody species of the northern hemisphere, mostly from ca. the last three decades. Recent research has demonstrated that mobilized online herbarium specimens provide important, albeit mostly neglected, information on plant phenology. Here, we use the web tool CrowdCurio to crowdsource phenological data from more than 10,000 herbarium specimens representing 30 flowering plant species broadly distributed across the eastern United States. Our results, spanning 120 years and generated from over 2,000 crowdsourcers, clarify numerous aspects of plant phenology. First, they reveal that plant reproductive phenology is significantly advancing in response to warming, which is consistent with previous studies. Second, among those species with broad latitudinal ranges, populations from more southern latitudes are significantly more phenologically sensitive to temperature than those from northern populations. Last, contrary to some recent findings, plants in warmer, less variable climates may be much more dynamic, on average, in their phenological sensitivity. Our results are robust to a variety of confounding factors and span large phylogenetic distances and myriad life histories. These may represent more global trends in the latitudinal gradient of phenological response with myriad potential ecological and evolutionary consequences, and leads us to hypothesize that phenological sensitivity across species' ranges is driven by adaptation to local climates.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/c50f3c0387015fa374551404ff35f944'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Assessing Plant Phenological Patterns in the Eastern United States Over the Last 120 Years']
"['Reproductive character displacement has long been hypothesized to be a key determinant of speciation and co-existence in flowering plants. A central tenet of this hypothesis is that reproductive traits of close relatives growing in sympatry diverge more than they do where close relatives do not grow together. However, this idea remains untested across taxa and at large spatial scales. Here, we use data collected from tens of thousands of herbarium specimens to examine evidence for character displacement in flowering time for 91 closely-related pairs of animal-pollinated angiosperm species in the eastern USA. We see no evidence for overall phenological divergence in sympatry across regions, clades, or life histories. Rather our results indicate widespread convergence of flowering times in sympatry for species pairs that generally tend to flower close in time. We also find that climate change could alter the nature of these convergent flowering events by shifting them further apart in a majority species pair comparisons. Specifically, congeneric species in New England and the Atlantic Coastal Plain are projected to flower 2–4 days further apart, on average, by the mid-21st century as warming temperatures drive species-specific phenological shifts within genera. This may have significant consequences for species interactions and gene flow, especially if current sympatric convergence in flowering times has resulted from facilitative interactions between species.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/bd1ea180b027735a608cb85cc869d4cb'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Assessing Plant Phenological Character Displacement Across the Eastern United States Since 1895']
"['Terrestrial salamanders are significant contributors to the overall vertebrate biomass in a forest (Burton and Likens 1975a).   Due to this abundance, they are ecologically important as both predators of soil fauna, and as prey for larger animals such as birds, reptiles, and small mammals (Welsh and Droege 2001).  In 1997, the invasive insect pest, hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) or HWA, was discovered on Hemlock Hill at Harvard University’s Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.  Unfortunately, this infestation has led to the death, decline, and removal of a larger percentage of the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) trees in this section of the Arboretum.  In April 2004, researchers from the Harvard Forest and the Arnold Arboretum began studying the environmental impacts of this disturbance event (HF061).  To complement this research twenty-four artificial cover objects (ACOs) were installed in three plots on Hemlock Hill in the summer of 2004 to monitor the relative abundance of eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and any other herpetofauna encountered.  The timing of the installation permitted an analysis of the effects of a logging treatment conducted in the winter of 2004-2005 on the relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders.\n            Logging had an immediate impact on the relative abundance of eastern red-backed salamanders in both logged plots as seen by an 83 percent decline in the relative abundance of red-backs in plot 1 and a 63 percent decline in plot 2 in the spring following logging versus the fall prior to logging.  In the unlogged control plot (plot 3) the relative abundance declined 9 percent in the spring versus the fall.  The lower relative abundances in the logged plots were likely due to higher temperatures on the surface of the soil (5.7 deg C) and five centimeters below the soil surface (1.2 deg C), and lower relative humidity on the surface of the soil (3.4%) than in the unlogged plot.  By Fall 2005, the relative abundance of red-backs had nearly recovered in plot 2 with only a 7% decline from Fall 2004, compared to a 15% increase in the control plot.  However, in plot 1 the relative abundance of red-backs declined further in Fall 2005 with 94% fewer salamanders than in Fall 2004.  These differences are likely because plot 1 is on a steeper slope leading to less retention of moisture and higher levels of sunlight reaching the forest floor than plot 2.  This physical difference led to plot 1 having higher temperatures on the surface of the soil, higher soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity on the surface of the soil than plot 2.\n            In addition to the 147 Eastern Red-back Salamander observations, twelve American Toad (Bufo americanus), three Northern Dusky Salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and one Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) observation were made under ACOs.  It is important to point out that many repeat observations were likely made, and that 147 observations does not suggest 147 unique red-backs observed.  Of the Eastern Red-backed Salamanders observed 40% were leadback morphs and 60% were red-back morphs.  This is a higher percentage of leadback morphs than in any of the 50 Eastern Red-backed Salamander populations in New England studied by Lotter and Scott (1977), and more similar to the percentages seen in populations in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio.  Interestingly, Lotter and Scott found that the frequency of leadback morphs is positively correlated with warmer climates.  All three Northern Dusky Salamander observations were made under ACO 6 in plot 1 in 2004, and this species was not observed again in 2005.   The Garter Snake observation was made in 2005 under ACO 10 in plot 2.\n            The relative abundance of red-backs in the control plot was higher than in any of the thirty second-growth eastern hemlock-dominated and mixed deciduous forests studied by the author during the same period in 2005.  However, this may be more a reflection of a lower abundance of coarse woody debris on the forest floor of Hemlock Hill than in the unmanaged forests studied in north central Massachusetts than an actual higher relative abundance of salamanders.  That is, fewer pieces of coarse woody debris would mean fewer natural cover objects for salamanders, thereby making ACOs more attractive.  Evidence that natural cover objects were less abundant at the Arboretum than in north central Massachusetts was the much higher frequency of multiple red-backs observed under the same ACO.  Two red-backs were observed under an ACO in 5% of observations at the Arboretum versus 0.6% of observations in north central Massachusetts, three observations were made under the same ACO in 2% of observations versus 0.08%, and four or more observations were made in 1% of observations versus 0%.\n            The Arnold Arboretum has a long history of breeding bird studies spanning from 1895 to 2005 which have allowed researchers to track changes in species composition over more than a century (Mayer 2005).  Similarly, the baseline data provided here will hopefully be used by future studies to assess potential changes in the relative abundance of terrestrial herpetofauna on Hemlock Hill at the Arnold Arboretum as it undergoes significant vegetative changes due to HWA infestation.  Another interesting question that future research will be able to assess is whether the percentage of leadback morphs in the population changes over time, given the potential changes in climate.  In the future hopefully other areas of the Arboretum will be studied as well including the woods to the west of the Bradley Collection of Rosaceous Plants where spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) could be breeding in the adjacent ponds, and Bussey Brook and the stream running through the Meadow which may provide habitat for northern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea bislineata).']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/212dcd451bcf47fb16723de1d8153a60'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Eastern Redback Salamander Abundance at the Arnold Arboretum 2004-2005']

"['1. Eastern redback salamander relative abundance\n            Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), an important late successional tree species, is currently threatened in this region by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), a small aphid-like invasive insect from Japan.  While many species of birds and mammals have found to be associated with eastern hemlock dominated stands, there have been very few studies examining amphibian relative abundance in this forest type.  Eastern redback salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) are important components of the forest ecosystem as they are extremely abundant with a biomass found to be twice that of breeding birds and equal to small mammals in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.  In addition, redbacks are positioned in the middle of the food web where they are important predators of soil invertebrates, potentially impacting soil respiration rates, and prey for larger vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and small mammals.  Redbacks have been cited as excellent indicators of forest health due to these characteristics as well as their low annual variation in abundance compared to other forest fauna.  The objectives of this study was to 1) establish baseline data on eastern redback salamander relative abundance in eastern hemlock dominated stands and mixed deciduous stands in the Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA using artificial cover objects (ACOs) 2) test for differences in redback relative abundance based on forest type, 3) test for correlations between redback relative abundance and soil pH and forest floor temperature.\n         \n         \n            2. Juvenile eastern red-spotted newt minimum density\n            This study provides baseline estimates of juvenile eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens) or ""red eft"" minimum density through visual surveys of transects in ten forest stands, five eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) dominated and five mixed deciduous, located in the Prospect Hill, Slab City, Simes, and Tom Swamp tracts of Harvard Forest.  The objectives of this study were to 1) acquire baseline minimum red eft density data at Harvard Forest, 2) test for potential differences in minimum density based on forest type, 3) test for correlations between minimum density and soil pH and forest floor temperature, 4) test for seasonal differences in minimum density estimates.\n         \n         \n            3. Time-constrained intensive searches\n            Intensive two minute searches of 1-m2 were conducted to measure eastern redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) abundance and juvenile eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens) or ""red eft"" abundance at ten stands, five eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) dominated and five mixed deciduous stands, in the Prospect Hill, Slab City, Simes, and Tom Swamp tracts of Harvard Forest in fall 2003 and spring 2004.  The objective of this study was to supplement other studies using artificial cover objects (ACOs) to measure eastern redback salamander relative abundance and transect walks to measure minimum density of red efts at Harvard Forest.\n         \n         \n            4. Artificial cover objects\n            Plethodontid salamanders are increasingly being cited as important indicators of forest health as they are major contributors to the overall faunal biomass in a forest.  In addition, they are positioned in the middle of the food web where they are important predators of soil invertebrates, potentially impacting soil respiration rates, as well as prey for higher vertebrates such as birds, small mammals, and reptiles.  Plethodon species also have lower annual coefficients of variation than other animals due to their small home ranges and terrestrial breeding habits.  A relatively new technique used in assessing plethodontid abundance is the installation and monitoring of artificial cover objects (ACOs).  Wood ACOs of different sizes have been effectively used as terrestrial salamander monitoring tools.  However, there is a concern that the quality of habitat under wooden cover objects may change over time as they weather thus altering their ability to track real changes in salamander abundance. More rot-resistant materials such as asphalt shingles may provide more consistent habitat over time.  This study compared the observation rates of   the most common plethodontid species in this region, the eastern redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) under artificial cover objects (ACOs) of the same surface area - 1m x 0.25m - but different materials - 2cm thick rough-cut eastern hemlock boards and asphalt shingles.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/4b1820492ec2572afbed3d79af400fc6'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Salamander Abundance at Harvard Forest 2003-2004']

"['The purpose of this experiment is to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grids and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogenfertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/13940d0f82389887764ab8142a11ce69'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Plant aboveground biomass data: Long-Term Nitrogen Deposition: Population, Community, and Ecosystem Consequences']"

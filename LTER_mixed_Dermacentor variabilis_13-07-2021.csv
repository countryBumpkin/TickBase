"['In an effort to determine exposure to ticks and to determine appropriate preventative measures to reduce the occurrence of Lyme Disease in summer research interns at Harvard Forest, data are collected about where students work at Harvard Forest; the time spent in the field; the number of ticks students find on themselves after each trip to the field; and the number of ticks that actually bite and embed themselves in the skin. From these data, we estimate areas of high tick densities and estimate time of summer during which ticks are most prevalent. The results are used to develop recommendations for appropriate precautions that students can take to avoid tick-borne diseases.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/22536ed700a7330153d826474d0c6873'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Incidence of Ticks and Tick Bites at Harvard Forest since 2006']
"['Wind data have been measured by an anemometer mounted 3\n      m above the ground at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\n      Headquarters since 1965. Prior to 1981, every mile of wind\n      movement caused a tick mark on a strip-chart recorder, and\n      wind direction as N, S, E, W, or a combination, was recorded\n      continuously. Since 1981, wind speed and direction have been\n      collected by an automatic data logger system. In 2004, a R.M.\n      Young company wind speed direction sensor (model 05103) was\n      installed. Since that time wind direction (azimuth) are based\n      on a 0 to 360 degree scale.\n      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook\n      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at\n      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and\n      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research\n      Station.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/b9a061361edd036a7f988aa83c557e83'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USDA Forest Service):\n    Wind Speed and Wind Direction Measurements, 1965 -\n    present']"

"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys\xa0spp.) are burrowing rodents considered to be ecosystem engineers and keystone species of the central grasslands of North America.

"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands. Both Gunnisonâ€™s and black-tailed prairie dogs can increase the number of plant species in grasslands and landscape heterogeneity with their ecosystem engineering that creates disturbed patches on the landscape. Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"
"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are considered keystone species of grassland ecosystems, and co-occur in the arid grasslands of the southwestern United States and in Mexico. Their keystone status is attributed primarily to the effects of their burrowing and foraging behavior, but they differ ecologically in several important respects. We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.

"[""Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019\n  Understanding factors that influence a species' distribution and abundance across the annual cycle is required for range-wide conservation. Thousands of imperiled red knots (Calidris cantus rufa) stop on Virginia's barrier islands each year to replenish fat during spring migration. We investigated the variation in red knot presence and flock size, the effects of prey on this variation, and factors influencing prey abundance on Virginia's barrier islands. We counted red knots and collected potential prey samples at randomly selected sites from 2007 - 2018 during a two-week period during early and peak migration. Core samples contained crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), coquina clams (Donax variabilis), and miscellaneous prey (horseshoe crab eggs (Limulus polyphemus), angel wing clams (Cyrtopleura costata), and other organisms (e.g., insect larvae, snails, worms)). Estimated red knot numbers in Virginia during peak migration were highest in 2012 (11,959) and lowest in 2014 (2,857; 12-year peak migration xÌ„ = 7,175, SD = 2,869). Red knot and prey numbers varied across sampling periods and substrates (i.e., peat and sand). Red knots generally used sites with more prey. Miscellaneous prey (xÌ„ = 18.85/core sample, SE = 0.88) influenced red knot presence at a site early in migration, when we only sampled on peat banks. Coquina clams (xÌ„ = 11/core sample, SE = 0.30) and blue mussels (xÌ„ = 0.94/core sample, SE = 0.04) affected red knot presence at a site during peak migration, when we sampled both substrates. Few relationships between prey and red knot flock size existed, suggesting that other unmeasured factors determined red knot numbers at occupied sites. Tide and mean daily water temperature affected prey abundance. Maximizing the diversity, availability, and abundance of prey for red knots on barrier islands requires management that encourages the presence of both sand and peat bank intertidal habitats.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/71f2afaf22ce0099b80afc70f824acdf'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019']"

"['The distribution and abundance of macromoth species is strongly influenced by geographical (region-neighboring plots) scale, elevation, aspect, plant community, management regime, and time of year. Noctural macromoths have been observed at a total of 263 sample sites throughout the Andrews Forest watershed since 1994.  Only a limited subset of these sites is sampled each year.  From 2004 to 2008, 20 sites were sampled consistently using a hierarchical sampling design stratified by elevation and vegetation type. Moths are sampled using blacklight traps deployed for one night every two weeks at each site from April through October.  A total of 503 species have been observed, and approximately 300 species may be observed in any given year. The watershed can be divided into 13 distinct zones. The northwest ridge above the Andrews headquarters has the highest number of species (n = 321) and the lowest number of species occurred at upper Lookout Creek (n = 239). Each of 13 zones is missing ca. 200 of the 500 resident species, suggesting that heterogeneity in the landscape is important. A breakdown of the species into functional groups based on larval feeding habits: conifers, hardwood, herb, mix, unknown shows that 43% of Andrews species rely on a hardwoods and 63% rely on hardwoods and herbaceous angiosperms. Conifer-feeders only represent 8% of moth species.  However, moths associated with conifer hosts are the most abundant; for instance, in the zone representing the midlevel of Carpenter Mountain 67% of moth individuals are conifer feeders, but only 14% of the species feed on conifers. In contrast, within the zone represented by the Headquarters site, only 32% of the individual moths feed on conifers whereas 56% feed on hardwoods.

"['In an effort to determine exposure to ticks and to determine appropriate preventative measures to reduce the occurrence of Lyme Disease in summer research interns at Harvard Forest, data are collected about where students work at Harvard Forest; the time spent in the field; the number of ticks students find on themselves after each trip to the field; and the number of ticks that actually bite and embed themselves in the skin. From these data, we estimate areas of high tick densities and estimate time of summer during which ticks are most prevalent. The results are used to develop recommendations for appropriate precautions that students can take to avoid tick-borne diseases.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/22536ed700a7330153d826474d0c6873'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Incidence of Ticks and Tick Bites at Harvard Forest since 2006']
"['Wind data have been measured by an anemometer mounted 3\n      m above the ground at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\n      Headquarters since 1965. Prior to 1981, every mile of wind\n      movement caused a tick mark on a strip-chart recorder, and\n      wind direction as N, S, E, W, or a combination, was recorded\n      continuously. Since 1981, wind speed and direction have been\n      collected by an automatic data logger system. In 2004, a R.M.\n      Young company wind speed direction sensor (model 05103) was\n      installed. Since that time wind direction (azimuth) are based\n      on a 0 to 360 degree scale.\n      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook\n      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at\n      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and\n      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research\n      Station.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/b9a061361edd036a7f988aa83c557e83'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USDA Forest Service):\n    Wind Speed and Wind Direction Measurements, 1965 -\n    present']"
"['Data set contains summaries (summer) of the number of individuals of each species of small mammal captured (relative abundance) on each transect. Each record contains date, treatment, transect, trap station, species, specimen number, recapture status, specimen disposition, external body measurements (where applicable), reproductive information, and miscellaneous associated comments. These sampling records are based on nightly captures during one 4-night trapping period in summer (June through August) for each of 16 permanent transects established on eight fire treatments (two transects per treatment). These treatments include two seasonal burn watersheds (SpB, SuB), two reversal burn watersheds (R1A, R20A), one annual burn watershed (1D), two 4-year burn watersheds (4B, 4F, and one 20-year burn watershed (20B). None of these treatments implement bison grazing.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/69109c56fcf21a30a8d37369cb47f8de'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['CSM08 Small mammal host-parasite sampling data for 16 linear trapping transects located in 8 LTER burn treatment watersheds at Konza Prairie']

"['In an effort to determine exposure to ticks and to determine appropriate preventative measures to reduce the occurrence of Lyme Disease in summer research interns at Harvard Forest, data are collected about where students work at Harvard Forest; the time spent in the field; the number of ticks students find on themselves after each trip to the field; and the number of ticks that actually bite and embed themselves in the skin. From these data, we estimate areas of high tick densities and estimate time of summer during which ticks are most prevalent. The results are used to develop recommendations for appropriate precautions that students can take to avoid tick-borne diseases.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/22536ed700a7330153d826474d0c6873'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Incidence of Ticks and Tick Bites at Harvard Forest since 2006']
"['Wind data have been measured by an anemometer mounted 3\n      m above the ground at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\n      Headquarters since 1965. Prior to 1981, every mile of wind\n      movement caused a tick mark on a strip-chart recorder, and\n      wind direction as N, S, E, W, or a combination, was recorded\n      continuously. Since 1981, wind speed and direction have been\n      collected by an automatic data logger system. In 2004, a R.M.\n      Young company wind speed direction sensor (model 05103) was\n      installed. Since that time wind direction (azimuth) are based\n      on a 0 to 360 degree scale.\n      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook\n      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at\n      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and\n      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research\n      Station.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/b9a061361edd036a7f988aa83c557e83'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USDA Forest Service):\n    Wind Speed and Wind Direction Measurements, 1965 -\n    present']"

"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys\xa0spp.) are burrowing rodents considered to be ecosystem engineers and keystone species of the central grasslands of North America. Yet, prairie dog populations have declined by an estimated 98% throughout their historic range. This dramatic decline has resulted in the widespread loss of their important ecological role throughout this grassland system. The 92,060 ha Sevilleta NWR in central New Mexico includes more than 54,000 ha of native grassland. Gunnison’s prairie dogs (C.\xa0gunnisoni) were reported to occupy ~15,000 ha of what is now the SNWR during the 1960’s, prior to their systematic eradication. In 2010, we collaborated with local agencies and conservation organizations to restore the functional role of prairie dogs to the grassland system. Gunnison’s prairie dogs were reintroduced to a site that was occupied by prairie dogs 40 years ago. \xa0This work is part of a larger, long-term study where we are studying the ecological effects of prairie dogs as they re-colonize the grassland ecosystem.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/198a185fc20ca1b37bdf5ae3fb28158c'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Restoration Experiment (GPDREx): Population Dynamics within Grasslands at the Sevilleta National Widlife Refuge, New Mexico""]"

SevLTER partners directly with Sevilleta  National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico Game and Fish, USFS Rocky Mountain  Research Station and non-profit Prairie Dog Pals on this ambitious  effort to re-establish Gunnison’s prairie dogs to blue grama dominated  (Bouteloua gracilis) Great Plains grassland at the foothills of the Los  Pinos Mountains on Sevilleta. While engaged in wildlife management aimed  at translocation of approximately 3000 individual prairie dogs,  ultimately establishing 5-6 colonies over a 500 ha area, SevLTER is  focusing resources on monitoring population dynamics of reintroduced  prairie dogs and their effects on vegetation production and diversity,  soil disturbance and grasshopper community composition. In this  experiment, prairie dogs act as the treatment on a grassland site where  the species was extirpated 40 years ago. The long term nature of the  project lies in the course of re-establishing prairie dogs combined with  the ultimate research goal of describing the functional role of  Gunnison’s prairie dogs in an arid grassland ecosystem: first we are  challenged to develop and document an economical and efficient  management strategy which maximizes reintroduction success and colony  survival; second we are tasked with monitoring prairie dog dynamics and  their effects on the grassland throughout re-establishment and into a  future state, when presumably management intervention will have subsided  and we characterize the ecosystem as ‘restored’ – both in the face of  highly variable abiotic inputs such as precipitation and temperature and  biotic impacts such as predation.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/0a914c9867df457ad6e8155613b4156f'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Population Dynamics within Grasslands at the Sevilleta National Widlife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2014)""]"
"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands. Both Gunnisonâ€™s and black-tailed prairie dogs can increase the number of plant species in grasslands and landscape heterogeneity with their ecosystem engineering that creates disturbed patches on the landscape. Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"
"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are considered keystone species of grassland ecosystems, and co-occur in the arid grasslands of the southwestern United States and in Mexico. Their keystone status is attributed primarily to the effects of their burrowing and foraging behavior, but they differ ecologically in several important respects. We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness. Our results demonstrate complementary effects of two co-occurring keystone species on their associated biotic communities.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/fd88974034a95f667ea435515d0fa4a8'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Pino Gate Prairie Dog Study: Landscape-scale Vegetation Plot Data from the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (1999-2002)']"

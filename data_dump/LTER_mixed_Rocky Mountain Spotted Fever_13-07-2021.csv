"['In an effort to determine exposure to ticks and to determine appropriate preventative measures to reduce the occurrence of Lyme Disease in summer research interns at Harvard Forest, data are collected about where students work at Harvard Forest; the time spent in the field; the number of ticks students find on themselves after each trip to the field; and the number of ticks that actually bite and embed themselves in the skin. From these data, we estimate areas of high tick densities and estimate time of summer during which ticks are most prevalent. The results are used to develop recommendations for appropriate precautions that students can take to avoid tick-borne diseases.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/22536ed700a7330153d826474d0c6873'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Incidence of Ticks and Tick Bites at Harvard Forest since 2006']
"['Wind data have been measured by an anemometer mounted 3\n      m above the ground at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest\n      Headquarters since 1965. Prior to 1981, every mile of wind\n      movement caused a tick mark on a strip-chart recorder, and\n      wind direction as N, S, E, W, or a combination, was recorded\n      continuously. Since 1981, wind speed and direction have been\n      collected by an automatic data logger system. In 2004, a R.M.\n      Young company wind speed direction sensor (model 05103) was\n      installed. Since that time wind direction (azimuth) are based\n      on a 0 to 360 degree scale.\n      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook\n      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at\n      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and\n      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research\n      Station.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/b9a061361edd036a7f988aa83c557e83'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USDA Forest Service):\n    Wind Speed and Wind Direction Measurements, 1965 -\n    present']"

"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands.

Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"

We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.

"[""Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019\n  Understanding factors that influence a species' distribution and abundance across the annual cycle is required for range-wide conservation. Thousands of imperiled red knots (Calidris cantus rufa) stop on Virginia's barrier islands each year to replenish fat during spring migration. We investigated the variation in red knot presence and flock size, the effects of prey on this variation, and factors influencing prey abundance on Virginia's barrier islands. We counted red knots and collected potential prey samples at randomly selected sites from 2007 - 2018 during a two-week period during early and peak migration. Core samples contained crustaceans (Orders Amphipoda and Calanoida), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), coquina clams (Donax variabilis), and miscellaneous prey (horseshoe crab eggs (Limulus polyphemus), angel wing clams (Cyrtopleura costata), and other organisms (e.g., insect larvae, snails, worms)). Estimated red knot numbers in Virginia during peak migration were highest in 2012 (11,959) and lowest in 2014 (2,857; 12-year peak migration xÌ„ = 7,175, SD = 2,869). Red knot and prey numbers varied across sampling periods and substrates (i.e., peat and sand). Red knots generally used sites with more prey. Miscellaneous prey (xÌ„ = 18.85/core sample, SE = 0.88) influenced red knot presence at a site early in migration, when we only sampled on peat banks. Coquina clams (xÌ„ = 11/core sample, SE = 0.30) and blue mussels (xÌ„ = 0.94/core sample, SE = 0.04) affected red knot presence at a site during peak migration, when we sampled both substrates. Few relationships between prey and red knot flock size existed, suggesting that other unmeasured factors determined red knot numbers at occupied sites. Tide and mean daily water temperature affected prey abundance. Maximizing the diversity, availability, and abundance of prey for red knots on barrier islands requires management that encourages the presence of both sand and peat bank intertidal habitats.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/71f2afaf22ce0099b80afc70f824acdf'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Red Knot observations on the Virginia Coast, 2007-2019']"

Moths are sampled using blacklight traps deployed for one night every two weeks at each site from April through October.  A total of 503 species have been observed, and approximately 300 species may be observed in any given year. The watershed can be divided into 13 distinct zones. The northwest ridge above the Andrews headquarters has the highest number of species (n = 321) and the lowest number of species occurred at upper Lookout Creek (n = 239). Each of 13 zones is missing ca. 200 of the 500 resident species, suggesting that heterogeneity in the landscape is important. A breakdown of the species into functional groups based on larval feeding habits: conifers, hardwood, herb, mix, unknown shows that 43% of Andrews species rely on a hardwoods and 63% rely on hardwoods and herbaceous angiosperms.

Increased spread of\n  infectious disease is often cited as a potential negative effect of\n  habitat corridors used in conservation, but the impacts of corridors\n  on pathogen movement have never been tested empirically. Using sweet\n  corn (Zea mays) and southern corn leaf blight (Cochliobolus\n  heterostrophus) as a model plant-pathogen system, we tested the\n  impacts of connectivity and habitat fragmentation on pathogen movement\n  and disease development at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina,\n  USA. Over time, less edgy patches had higher proportions of diseased\n  plants, and distance of host plants to habitat edges was the greatest\n  determinant of disease development. Variation in average daytime\n  temperatures provided a possible mechanism for these disease patterns.\n  Our results show that worries over the potentially harmful effects of\n  conservation corridors on disease dynamics are misplaced, and that, in\n  a conservation context, many diseases can be better managed by\n  mitigating edge effects.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/f23a3be45f483d23bb09adead1fc5d53'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Edge effects, not connectivity, determine the incidence and development of a foliar fungal plant disease']"

"['This layer is a high-resolution tree canopy change-detection layer for Baltimore City, MD. It contains three tree-canopy classes for the period 2007-2015: (1) No Change; (2) Gain; and (3) Loss.

Tree canopy that existed during both time periods was assigned to the No Change category while trees removed by development, storms, or disease were assigned to the Loss class. Trees planted during the interval were assigned to the Gain category, as were the edges of existing trees that expanded noticeably. Direct comparison was possible because both the 2007 and 2015 maps were created using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and included similar source datasets (LiDAR-derived surface models, multispectral imagery, and thematic GIS inputs). OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.

"['Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands. Both Gunnisonâ€™s and black-tailed prairie dogs can increase the number of plant species in grasslands and landscape heterogeneity with their ecosystem engineering that creates disturbed patches on the landscape. Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnisonâ€™s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/47b70070ab9a1ba933cba7d082215236'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"[""Gunnison's Prairie Dog Relocation Project: Vegetation Cover Data from the Sevilleta National Wildife Refuge, New Mexico (2005-2013)""]"
"['Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) are considered keystone species of grassland ecosystems, and co-occur in the arid grasslands of the southwestern United States and in Mexico. Their keystone status is attributed primarily to the effects of their burrowing and foraging behavior, but they differ ecologically in several important respects. We studied the comparative functional roles of these species where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation. We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds. Certain species and functional groups of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals. The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.

"['This soil moisture study was initiated in 1960 to investigate the effects of patch clearcut logging and slash burning (1962-63) in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in the Oregon Cascade Range.  Since soil moisture and vegetation sampling continued regularly until 1980, this is a unique data set that represents nearly two decades of post-treatment information.\n      \nPlant cover exerts a profound influence on soil moisture levels through its effects on interception, infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration.  In the Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest, clearcut logging and slash burning are common practices that can dramatically alter plant cover and soil moisture.  Logging can increase soil moisture by temporarily reducing cover and associated water use, and burning may further augment soil moisture levels by suppressing the survival and regrowth of vegetation.  Indeed, part of the rationale for slash burning in the region is to control shrubs and other vegetation that would otherwise compete with conifer seedlings for available moisture, light, and nutrients.  Within a few years after burning, however, invading vegetation may deplete soil moisture to levels comparable to forested areas.  Such  observations point to the value of long-term information to better understand dynamic soil moisture and plant cover responses to forest practices.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/a56385be60eeb67ba0a8edbefa5f9e93'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Soil Moisture and  vegetation cover patterns after logging and burning an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in the Andrews Experimental Forest, 1960-1983']"
"[""The factors that contribute to plant species establishment and decline following disturbance determine the rates and patterns of successional change of a system. In this long-term field experiment, we test the commonly held assumption that competition for space or resources by dominant species determines the outcome of succession. Specifically, we examine the population- and community-level consequences of removing one or more potentially dominant species from the post-disturbance community after clearcut logging and burning of a mature/old-growth Douglas-fir forest. Experimental treatments include: (1) removal of early-seral annual, Senecio sylvaticus, or perennial, Epilobium angustifolium—or both—to test the influences of these early-seral dominants on subsequent community development; (2) removal of all species except Senecio or Epilobium, to test whether the decline of these early-seral dominants is driven by competitive displacement; or (3) removal of shade-tolerant forest species that dominate subsequent stages of succession—Rubus ursinus or Berberis nervosa plus Gaultheria shallon—to test the influences of these long-lived perennials on understory development. The experiment is a randomized block design comprising eight removal treatments plus a control replicated in each of 25 blocks. Removal (reduction in competition) is achieved by removing seedlings or vegetative stems annually from a treatment area of 2.5 x 2.5 m. Sample plots (1 x 1 m) centered within these are used to estimate cover of all vascular plant species and, for the first 8 yr of the experiment, stem density and height, facilitating estimates of above-ground biomass. Pre-harvest data were collected in 1990, logging/burning occurred in 1991, and removal treatments and post-treatment sampling were initiated in 1992. Six of the nine experimental treatments were terminated between 1996 and 1998, with loss of early-seral Senecio and Epilobium from the system. The remaining three treatments (removal of Rubus, removal of Berberis plus Gaultheria, and the control) have been sampled annually since 1992.  All regeneration of trees within the experimental area has occurred naturally. In September 2018, the study site partially burned during the larger Terwilliger Fire on the Willamette National Forest. In 2019, plots were assessed for burn severity. Species' removals were terminated, but cover measurements continue in the plots.""]",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/4f23d0d998bc19db6ee68b767c8772bf'],['unkown'],[''],[''],"['Species interactions during succession in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, 1990 to present']"

Despite planting, most tree stems originated naturally, either as sprouts from cut stumps (hardwoods) or as natural regeneration (conifers and hardwoods).  Study plots were established and sampled for cover and frequency of understory vegetation and counts of seedlings and saplings prior to harvest (1973) and resampled annually for cover and biomass of understory vegetation and tree growth from 1976-1981, then in 1983, 1985, and then in 4-6 year intervals.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of rotenone application in Hidden lake during summer 2018 on macroinvertebrates communities.']",['\n            '],['doi:10.6073/pasta/3bc27eeccd0f943fe7d19678bd67a6ad'],['unkown'],[''],[''],['Macroinvertebrates communities from 14 lakes of the Canadian Rockies in summer and fall 2018.']

"['Both large-wildlife loss and climatic changes can independently influence the prevalence and distribution of zoonotic disease. Given growing evidence that wildlife loss often has stronger community-level effects in low-productivity areas, we hypothesized that these perturbations would have interactive effects on disease risk. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by measuring tick abundance and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia spp.) within long-term, size-selective, large-herbivore exclosures replicated across a precipitation gradient in East Africa. Total wildlife exclusion increased total tick abundance by 130% (mesic sites) to 225% (dry, low-productivity sites), demonstrating a significant interaction of defaunation and aridity on tick abundance. When differing degrees of exclusion were tested for a subset of months, total tick abundance increased from 170% (only mega-herbivores excluded) to 360% (all large wildlife excluded). Wildlife exclusion differentially affected the abundance of the three dominant tick species, and this effect varied strongly over time, likely due to differences among species in their host associations, seasonality, and other ecological characteristics. Pathogen prevalence did not differ across wildlife exclusion treatments, rainfall levels, or tick species, suggesting that exposure risk will respond to defaunation and climate change in proportion to total tick abundance. These findings demonstrate interacting effects of defaunation and aridity that increase disease risk, and they highlight the need to incorporate ecological context when predicting effects of wildlife loss on zoonotic disease dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Georgia', 'lastName': 'Titcomb', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Brian F.', 'lastName': 'Allan', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Ainsworth', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Henson', 'lastName': 'Lauren', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Hedlund', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Robert M.', 'lastName': 'Pringle', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Todd M.', 'lastName': 'Palmer', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y3ad647'}, {'firstName': 'Laban', 'lastName': 'Njoroge', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Campana', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'Robert C.', 'lastName': 'Fleischer', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'John Naisikie', 'lastName': 'Mantas', 'affiliation': 'Mpala Research Center and Wildlife Foundation', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04c466w42'}, {'firstName': 'Hillary S.', 'lastName': 'Young', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Lauren', 'lastName': 'Henson', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.sf33k'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Interacting effects of wildlife loss and climate on ticks and tick-borne disease']
"['<p>The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics), or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of Neotropical ticks, collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites, but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. <i>Francisella </i>and <i>Rickettsia </i>were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species and we found both positive and negative co-occurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g. <i>Coxiella</i>, <i>Rickettsiella</i>) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected <i>Anaplasma</i> and <i>Bartonella </i>in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of Neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species, life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Jordan', 'lastName': 'Kueneman', 'email': 'jordan.kue@gmail.com', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/035jbxr46', 'orcid': '0000-0001-9521-6282'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.h9w0vt4h0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Tick microbiomes in neotropical forest fragments are best explained by tick-associated and environmental factors rather than host blood source ']
"['The datasets of records of the distribution of ticks are invaluable tools to understand the phylogenetic patterns of evolution of ticks and the abiotic traits to which they are associated. Such datasets require an exhaustive collection of bibliographical references. In most cases, it is necessary the confirmation of reliable identification of ticks, together with an update of the scientific names of the vertebrate hosts. For some biogeographic regions, these data are not easily available, because many records were published in the so-called “grey literature”. We introduce the Dataset of Ticks in South America, a repository that collates data on more than 7,000 records of ticks, together with a set of abiotic traits, curated from satellite-derived information over the complete target region. The dataset includes data about ticks collected on wild hosts, with a special chapter devoted to species of cattle.

"['The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus is currently invading the West African region, and little information is available on the spread of this exotic tick in this region. We set out a country-wide field survey to determine its current distribution in Benin. Ticks were collected on cattle from 106 farms selected by random sampling covering all regions of the country. Rhipicephalus annulatus was found on 70 % of all farms, R. decoloratus on 42 %, R. geigyi on 58 %, and R. microplus on 49 %. There is a clear geographic separation between the indigenous Rhipicephalus species and R. microplus. Rhipicephalus annulatus occurs mainly in the northern departments, but it was also observed in lower numbers in locations in the south. The presence of R. decoloratus is limited to the northern region, and in most locations, this tick makes up a small proportion of the collected ticks. The tick R. geigyi tends to be dominant, but occurs only in the four northern departments. The observations concerning R. microplus are entirely different, this species occurs in the southern and central region. The results of this survey confirm the invasive character and displacement properties of R. microplus, since in less than a decade it has colonized more than half of the country and has displaced indigenous ticks of the same genus in many of the sampled locations.']","[[{'firstName': 'Eva M.', 'lastName': 'De Clercq', 'affiliation': 'Université Catholique de Louvain', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02495e989'}, {'firstName': 'S.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.']","[[{'firstName': 'Richard S.', 'lastName': 'Ostfeld', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Taal', 'lastName': 'Levi', 'affiliation': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00ysfqy60'}, {'firstName': 'Felicia', 'lastName': 'Keesing', 'affiliation': 'Bard College', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04yrgt058'}, {'firstName': 'Kelly', 'lastName': 'Oggenfuss', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Charles D.', 'lastName': 'Canham', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d1c8046'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tick-borne disease risk in a forest food web']
"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole. Furthermore, field-acquired bacteria appear to be very important to the overall internal bacterial community of this tick species, with influence from the host bloodmeal appearing limited.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Christine P.', 'lastName': 'Zolnik', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Robert J.', 'lastName': 'Prill', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Richard C.', 'lastName': 'Falco', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas J.', 'lastName': 'Daniels', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Sergios-Orestis', 'lastName': 'Kolokotronis', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mt6m0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Microbiome changes through ontogeny of a tick pathogen vector']

"['Predators and competitors of vertebrates can in theory reduce the density of infected nymphs (DIN)—an often-used measure of tick-borne disease risk—by lowering the density of reservoir-competent hosts and/or the tick burden on reservoir-competent hosts. We investigated this possible indirect effect of predators by comparing data from 20 forest plots across the Netherlands that varied in predator abundance. In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens. We found that larval burden on two rodent species decreased with activity of two predator species, while DON and DIN for all three pathogens increased with larval burden on rodents, as predicted. Path analyses supported an indirect negative correlation of activity of both predator species with DON and DIN. Our results suggest that predators can indeed lower the number of ticks feeding on reservoir-competent hosts, which implies that changes in predator abundance may have cascading effects on tick-borne disease risk.']","[[{'firstName': 'Tim R.', 'lastName': 'Hofmeester', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Patrick A.', 'lastName': 'Jansen', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/035jbxr46'}, {'firstName': 'Hendrikus J.', 'lastName': 'Wijnen', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Elena C.', 'lastName': 'Coipan', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Manoj', 'lastName': 'Fonville', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Herbert H.T.', 'lastName': 'Prins', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Hein', 'lastName': 'Sprong', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Sip E.', 'lastName': 'van Wieren', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Herbert H.

"['<p>Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards (<i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i>) are a key host to western black-legged ticks (<i>Ixodes pacificus</i>). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures or both. We infested males with larval ticks and staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits.

This is the first demonstration of the impact of <i>I. pacificus</i> parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards, and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness.

"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']
"['The ‘trade-off’ hypothesis for virulence evolution assumes that between-host transmission rate is a positive and saturating function of pathogen exploitation and virulence, but there are as yet few tests of this assumption, in particular for vector-borne pathogens. Here, I show that the infectivity (probability of transmission) of the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii from two of its natural rodent hosts (bank vole and yellow-necked mouse) to its main tick vector increases asymptotically with increasing exploitation (measured as bacterial load in skin biopsies). Hence, this result provides support for one of the basic assumptions of the ‘trade-off hypothesis’. Moreover, there was no difference in infectivity between bank voles and yellow-necked mice despite bacterial loads being on average an order of magnitude higher in bank voles, most likely because ticks took larger blood meals from mice.

"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales. Moreover, we illustrate how species distribution models, in combination with temporally refined species occurrence and environmental data, can be used to investigate environmental factors predictive of geographic variation in seasonality or phenology of vector species. This produces not only novel ecological insight, but key information for public health practitioners in managing vector-borne disease transmission and targeting public outreach and interventions.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald'}, {'firstName': 'Craig', 'lastName': ""O'Neill""}, {'firstName': 'Melissa H.', 'lastName': 'Yoshimizu'}, {'firstName': 'Kerry A.', 'lastName': 'Padgett'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8769t44'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracking seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick across California']
"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']
"['<p>Ecological factors and individual-specific traits affect parasite infestation in wild animals. We studied various key ecological variables (breeding density, human disturbance) and phenotypic traits (exploratory behaviour, body condition) proposed to predict tick infestation probability and burden in great tits (<i>Parus major</i>). Our study spanned three years and 12 nest-box plots located in southern Germany. Adult breeders were assessed for exploration behaviour, body condition, and tick burden. Plots were open to human recreation; human disturbance was quantified in each plot as a recreation pressure index from biweekly nest box inspections. Infested individuals were repeatable in tick burden across years. These repeatable among-individual differences in tick burden were not attributable to exploration behaviour. However, faster explorers did have a higher infestation probability. Furthermore, body condition negatively correlated to tick burden. Recreation pressure also tended to increase infestation probability. Our study implies that avian infestation probability and tick burden are each governed by distinct phenotypic traits and ecological factors. Our findings highlight the importance of animal behaviour and human disturbance in understanding variation in tick burden among avian hosts.</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Robert E.', 'lastName': 'Rollins', 'email': 'rollins@bio.lmu.de', 'affiliation': 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05591te55', 'orcid': '0000-0002-5779-7001'}, {'firstName': 'Alexia', 'lastName': 'Mouchet', 'email': 'mouchet@biologie.uni-muenchen.de', 'affiliation': 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05591te55'}, {'firstName': 'Gabriele', 'lastName': 'Margos', 'email': 'Gabriele.Margos@lgl.bayern.de', 'affiliation': 'Bayerisches Landesamt für Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04bqwzd17'}, {'firstName': 'Lidia', 'lastName': 'Chitimia-Dobler', 'email': 'lydiachitimia@gmail.com', 'affiliation': 'Bayerisches Landesamt für Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04bqwzd17'}, {'firstName': 'Volker', 'lastName': 'Fingerle', 'email': 'Volker.Fingerle@lgl.bayern.de', 'affiliation': 'Institut für Mikrobiologie der Bundeswehr'}, {'firstName': 'Noémie S.', 'lastName': 'Becker', 'email': 'nbecker@bio.lmu.de', 'affiliation': 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05591te55', 'orcid': '0000-0002-4968-4103'}, {'firstName': 'Niels J.', 'lastName': 'Dingemanse', 'email': 'dingemanse@biologie.uni-muenchen.de', 'affiliation': 'Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05591te55', 'orcid': '0000-0003-3320-0861'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.v41ns1rtz'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Repeatable differences in exploratory behaviour predict tick infestation probability in wild great tits']
"['Nonhuman primate species spend a conspicuous amount of time grooming during social interactions, a behaviour that probably serves both social and health-related functions. While the social implications of grooming have been relatively well studied, less attention has been paid to the health benefits, especially the removal of ectoparasites, which may act as vectors in disease transmission. In this study, we examined whether grooming behaviour reduced tick load (number of ticks) and haemoprotozoan infection status in a population of wild adult baboons (Papio cynocephalus). We found that younger and higher-ranking adults were groomed more often than older, low-ranking adults, and females were groomed more often than males. Animals that received more grooming, in turn, had lower tick loads. Baboons with lower tick loads had higher packed red cell volume (PCV or haematocrit), one general measure of health status. We detected a tick-borne haemoprotozoan, Babesia microti, but its low prevalence in the population precluded identifying sources of variance in infection.']","[[{'firstName': 'Mercy Y.', 'lastName': 'Akinyi', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Susan C.', 'lastName': 'Alberts', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Jeanne', 'lastName': 'Altmann', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Nilesh B.', 'lastName': 'Patel', 'affiliation': 'University of Nairobi', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y9nww90'}, {'firstName': 'Jenny', 'lastName': 'Tung', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Maamun', 'lastName': 'Jeneby', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3r8n2'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Role of grooming in reducing tick load in wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus)']

We investigated bacterial community composition and diversity of the ticks Dermacentor variabilis (n = 68) and Ixodes scapularis (n = 15) and blood of their shared rodent host, Peromyscus leucopus (n = 45) to quantify bacterial diversity and concordance. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

We determined prevalence and infection intensity of ospC strains in naturally infected wild mammals (rodents and shrews) by 454 amplicon sequencing in combination with qPCR. Neither prevalence nor infection intensity of specific ospC strains varied in a species-specific manner (i.e. there were no significant ospC × host species interactions). Rankings of ospC prevalences were strongly positively correlated across host species. Rankings of ospC infection intensities were correlated more weakly, but only in one case significantly less than 1. ospC prevalences in the studied mammals were similar to those in ticks sampled at the study site, indicating that we did not miss any mammal species that are important hosts for specific ospC strains.

"['Background: The prolonged feeding process of ixodid ticks, in combination with bacterial transmission, should lead to a robust inflammatory response at the blood-feeding site. Yet, factors present in tick saliva may down-regulate such responses, which may be beneficial to spirochete transmission. The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that tick saliva, in the context of Borrelia burgdorferi, can have widespread effects on the production of immune mediators in skin.  Methods: A cross-section of tick feeding on skin was examined histologically. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"[""1. Assessing the impacts of multiple, often synergistic, stressors on the population dynamics of long-lived species is becoming increasingly important due to recent and future global change. 2. Tiliqua rugosa (sleepy lizard) is a long-lived skink (>30 years) that is adapted to survive in semi-arid environments with varying levels of parasite exposure and highly seasonal food availability. We used an exhaustive database of 30-years of capture-mark-recapture records to quantify the impacts of both parasite exposure and environmental conditions on the lizard's survival rates and long-term population dynamics. 3. Lizard abundance was relatively stable throughout the study period; however there were changing patterns in adult and juvenile apparent survival rates, driven by spatial and temporal variation in levels of tick exposure and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Extreme weather events during the winter and spring seasons were identified as important environmental drivers of survival. 4. Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme hot and dry winter and spring seasons in our South Australian study region; from a contemporary probability of 0.17 up to 0.47 - 0.83 in 2080 depending on the emissions scenario. Our stochastic population model projections showed that these future climatic conditions will induce a decline in the abundance of this long-lived reptile of up to 67% within 30 years from 2080, under worst case scenario modelling. 5. The results have broad implications for future work investigating the drivers of population dynamics and persistence.

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"
"['The endophilic tick Ixodes arboricola infests cavity-nesting birds, and its dispersal strongly depends on the movements of its host. Population genetic structure of I. arboricola was studied with seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. We collected 268 ticks from 76 nest boxes in four woodlots near Antwerp, Belgium. These nest boxes are mainly used by the principal hosts of I. arboricola, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. As these birds typically return to the same cavity for roosting or breeding, ticks within nest boxes were expected to be highly related, and tick populations were expected to be spatially structured among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. In line with the expectations, genetic population structure was found among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. Surprisingly, there was considerable genetic variation among ticks within nest boxes. This could be explained by continuous gene flow from ticks from nearby tree holes, yet this remains to be tested. A pairwise relatedness analysis conducted for all pairs of ticks within nest boxes showed that relatedness among larvae was much higher than among later instars, which suggests that larvae are the most important instar for tick dispersal. Overall, tick populations at the studied spatial scale are not as differentiated as predicted, which may influence the scale at which host–parasite evolution occurs.']","[[{'firstName': 'Kurt', 'lastName': 'Jordaens', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Backeljau', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'A.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag. We highlight the important role of the genospecies’ pathogenicity and the host associations for understanding the epidemiology of disseminated Lyme borreliosis.']","[[{'firstName': 'Atle', 'lastName': 'Mysterud', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Dieter', 'lastName': 'Heylen', 'affiliation': 'University of Hasselt', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04nbhqj75'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Mathyssen', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Aïda', 'lastName': 'Garcia', 'affiliation': 'Lista Bird Observatory, 4563 Borhaug, Norway'}, {'firstName': 'Solveig', 'lastName': 'Jore', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Institute of Public Health', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/046nvst19'}, {'firstName': 'Hildegunn', 'lastName': 'Viljugrein', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.c7q3n2c'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Lyme neuroborreliosis and bird populations in northern Europe']
"['Modelling the spatial spread of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens maintained in enzootic transmission cycles remains a major challenge. The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach—occupancy modelling—to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases.

"['Historical patterns of dispersal and population isolation are key components shaping contemporary genetic diversity across landscapes and require explicit consideration when examining the relative role of different factors in driving the evolution of host specificity in parasitic organisms. In this study, we investigate the worldwide colonisation history of a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae. This tick has a circumpolar distribution across both hemispheres, but has repeatedly formed host-specific races within different regions. By combining mitochondrial and nuclear data, we infer how this species spread to its present-day distribution and how the colonisation process has affected the geographic and host-associated structure of this tick within regions. We demonstrate that I. uriae is highly structured and isolates into four genetic groups that correspond to well-defined geographical regions. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification of I. uriae began in the early Miocene (22 Myr) and that this tick colonised most of the Southern hemisphere before moving into northern latitudes via two independent routes. However, no relationship between the degree of host race divergence and colonisation history was evident, supporting previous hypotheses that host specialization evolves relatively rapidly in this parasite, but does not typically lead to speciation. We discuss the possible historical and contemporary mechanisms of large scale dispersal for this ectoparasite and how its biological characteristics may condition current patterns of genetic diversity. More generally, our results illustrate how combining broad-scale sampling and modern molecular tools can help disentangle complex patterns of diversification in widespread parasites.']","[[{'firstName': 'Muriel', 'lastName': 'Dietrich', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Florent', 'lastName': 'Kempf', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Boulinier', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive"", 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008rywf59'}, {'firstName': 'Karen D.', 'lastName': 'McCoy', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.ff71n'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracing the colonization and diversification of the worldwide seabird ectoparasite Ixodes uriae']

We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia.

"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l.

Within a colony, however, the local abundance, physical similarity, and nocturnal habits of penguins hinder the observation of fine-scale movements. To determine the extent of movement and interaction of penguins within colonies, a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach was used to study the fine-scale structure of ticks—which depend on host movements for dispersal—exploiting the largest Little Penguin (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) colony in Australia (Phillip Island, Victoria). No barriers to tick gene flow were identified, and we infer that extensive penguin movement occurs throughout the colony. Our findings support the hypothesis that some penguin species are highly gregarious, socializing widely within colonies despite strong nest-site philopatry.']","[[{'firstName': 'Katherine L.', 'lastName': 'Moon', 'affiliation': 'Monash University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02bfwt286'}, {'firstName': 'Ceridwen I.', 'lastName': 'Fraser', 'affiliation': 'Australian National University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592'}, {'firstName': 'Steven L.', 'lastName': 'Chown', 'affiliation': 'Monash University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02bfwt286'}, {'firstName': 'Angela', 'lastName': 'McGaughran', 'affiliation': 'Australian National University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t12dr12'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Penguin ectoparasite panmixia suggests extensive host movement within a colony']

"['Aim Organisms with poor intrinsic dispersal capacity, such as parasites, often rely entirely on transport with host species that have a greater dispersal capacity. Penguins, for example, are exploited by terrestrial ectoparasites when they come ashore to breed. Recent research indicates that little penguin (Eudyptula minor and E. novaehollandiae) hard ticks (Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi) may be capable of surviving short periods (days) at sea with their hosts, but their capacity to survive longer voyages (weeks) is not known. We here aimed to assess whether phylogeographic patterns in little penguins and their ticks indicate that the terrestrial ectoparasites are able to disperse long distances at sea with their swimming hosts. Location Southern Australia and New Zealand. Taxon Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi ticks.\r\nMethods We conducted a broad-scale genomic assessment of little penguin ticks from across their hosts’ ranges in Australia and New Zealand. Using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS), we generated SNP data sets from ticks from 14 penguin colonies, and analysed phylogeographic structure. We included ticks from some sympatric flighted seabirds to verify host-specificity. Results We resolved two distinct lineages of Ixodes from little penguins, with one restricted to Australia, and the other found throughout New Zealand and in low numbers at some eastern Australian sites. Both lineages exhibited phylogeographic structure consistent with patterns observed in their hosts, with some evidence of occasional oceanic dispersal, including across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Ticks from sympatric short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), which disperse aerially, were genetically distinct from those collected from little penguins, supporting prior evidence of host-specificity in seabird ticks. Main conclusions The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that ticks can travel at sea with little penguins. We infer that some terrestrial ectoparasites associated with aquatically-dispersing hosts have evolved the capacity to survive oceanic voyages.']","[[{'firstName': 'Katherine', 'lastName': 'Moon'}, {'firstName': 'Steven', 'lastName': 'Chown'}, {'firstName': 'Ceridwen', 'lastName': 'Fraser'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.1074560'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tandem host-parasite dispersal inferred from similarities in phylogeographic patterns among little penguins and their ‘terrestrial’ ectoparasites']

"['The seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) parasitizes over 60 host species in the circumpolar regions of both hemispheres, and acts as a vector for a number of potentially virulent pathogens. On Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, the nestlings of Cassin’s Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) are often parasitized by seabird ticks, which may affect their growth and survival in the nest. We used a logistic growth model to interpolate between successive measures of mass (g) and wing chord (mm) for 558 Cassin’s Auklet and 344 Rhinoceros Auklet chicks over 11 years from 1996 to 2007. From the model, we estimated the asymptotic measure and the age at inflection point for each chick’s growth trajectory, and assessed the effect of tick load relative to other sources of annual and seasonal variation in growth. Most chicks (72.4% of Cassin’s Auklets, and 62.2% of Rhinoceros Auklets) hosted ≥1 ticks at least once while in the nest, and the median tick load was two in both species. The probability of hosting a tick declined strongly with chick age, such that by day 40 after hatching less than 1% hosted ticks. We found evidence that tick load had a negative effect on asymptotic weights and wing lengths of both species, but the effect was minor relative to that of other sources of annual and seasonal variation. Only at very high loads – which were rare – did ticks have effects on growth that were likely to be biologically relevant. Tick load had little effect on survival to fledging in either species.We argue that these mild effects of ticks on their hosts are consistent with a co-evolutionary process that results in intermediate virulence when parasite transmission is linked to host recovery.']","[[{'firstName': 'J.

We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States.

If so, hosts that have <i>consistently</i> high parasite loads may serve as key reservoirs or super-spreaders. Thus, identifying whether individuals persistently differ in their parasitism and the factors that explain these patterns constitute important issues for disease ecology and management. To investigate these topics, we examined nine years of tick counts in a wild population of sleepy lizards, <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>. Lizards were individually marked, and throughout their activity season, often across several years, we repeatedly assessed lizards’ ticks (to stage – larva, nymph, adult male, and adult female – and species, either <i>Bothriocroton hydrosauri</i> or <i>Amblyomma limbatum</i>). Using these repeated individual measures, we determined whether tick counts were repeatable. Then, we tested predictors of average tick counts, particularly lizard mass, sex, behavioural type (aggression and boldness), and the distance between lizards’ home range centre and a road transecting the study site (an area of greater food and lizard activity). We found that lizards exhibited consistent individual differences in tick loads both within and across years. Within-lizard yearly average counts of larvae and nymphs were positively correlated. Lizards closer to the road tended to have more larvae and nymphs of both species and more adult <i>B. hydrosauri</i>. Sex did not affect tick counts. Mass differentially affected adult female <i>A. limbatum</i> and adult male <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts. Intriguingly, lizards with above average aggression but below average boldness, or vice versa, tended to have higher average adult female <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts.

We studied the interaction between the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>), a globally invasive species native to South America, and its <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks. Our field study of 642 cane toads across 46 sites within their native range in French Guiana revealed that 56% of toads carried ticks, and that toads with ticks were in poor body condition relative to uninfected conspecifics.

Reductions in the abundance of ticks in urban habitats may be attributable to pesticides (which are sprayed for mosquito control, but are also lethal to ticks), and our literature review shows that tick abundance is generally lower in cane toads from urban habitats across South America.

"['Urban species encounter resources that are uncommon in nature, such as materials found in city waste. Many studies have shown that these can be harmful to wildlife. In Mexico City, house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which reduces the amount of ectoparasites, but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet, the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively, disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches Carpodacus mexicanus increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present, fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away, we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest, as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched, and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks, 2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation.

After controlling for habitat, MHC diversity was not associated with tick number, and the habitats did not differ in this respect. Neither did we detect a difference between habitats in the relationship between MHC and neutral diversity, which was positive across all populations.

We found important differences between classes of vector, including an increased likelihood of amplified disease risk under additive biodiversity change in mosquito models, driven by higher vector biting rates. We also draw attention to more general phenomena, such as a negative relationship between initial infection prevalence in vectors and likelihood of dilution, and the potential for a rise in density of infected vectors to occur simultaneously with a decline in proportion of infected hosts.

In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper <i>Glyphorynchus spirurus</i>. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant.

"['The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large gene family that plays a central role in the immune system of all jawed vertebrates. Non-avian reptiles are under-represented within the MHC literature and little is understood regarding the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in this vertebrate group. Here, we examined the relative roles of parasite-mediated selection and sexual selection in maintaining MHC class I diversity of a colour polymorphic lizard. We discovered evidence for parasite-mediated selection acting via rare-allele advantage or fluctuating selection as ectoparasite load was significantly lower in the presence of a specific MHC supertype (functional clustering of alleles); supertype four. Based on comparisons between ectoparasite prevalence and load, and assessment of the impact of ectoparasite load on host fitness, we suggest that supertype four confers quantitative resistance to ticks or an intracellular tick-borne parasite. We found no evidence for MHC-associated mating in terms of pair genetic distance, number of alleles or specific supertypes . An association was uncovered between supertype four and male throat colour morph. However, it is unlikely that male throat colouration acts as a signal of MHC genotype to conspecifics because we found no evidence to suggest that male throat colouration predicts male mating status. Overall, our results suggest that parasite-mediated selection plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in this population via rare allele advantage and/or fluctuating selection. Further work is required to determine whether sexual selection also plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in agamid lizards.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jessica D.', 'lastName': 'Hacking', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}, {'firstName': 'Devi', 'lastName': 'Stuart-Fox', 'affiliation': 'University of Melbourne', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01ej9dk98'}, {'firstName': 'Stephanie S.', 'lastName': 'Godfrey', 'affiliation': 'University of Otago', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01jmxt844'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Gardner', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mr31757'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Specific MHC class I supertype associated with parasite infection and colour morph in a wild lizard population']
"['Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural, non-human populations. Here we use a natural rodent-Borrelia system to test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e. the product of Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment shapes the evolution of the host’s immune system in the wild.']","[[{'firstName': 'Luca', 'lastName': 'Cornetti', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Daniela', 'lastName': 'Hilfiker', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Mélissa', 'lastName': 'Lemoine', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.7sr405h'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Small-scale spatial variation in infection risk shapes the evolution of a Borrelia resistance gene in wild rodents']

The extent of cross-reactivity differed between mouse strains, being higher in C3H than BALB/c and C57BL/6.

Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair.

"['Genetically diverse infections are common but little is known about what effects coinfecting strains have on each other in natural host-parasite systems. To explore the nature and consequences of interactions in the wild, we studied the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia afzelii in one of its main reservoir hosts, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. We measured overall infection intensity with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and resolved the composition of multiple infections using strain-specific PCR assays targeting the ospC gene (which encodes an immunodominant surface protein). We found seven different strains, as defined by ospC genotype. There was little evidence for interactions affecting infection intensities, but strains were highly aggregated (i.e., there were more multiple infections than expected from random co-occurrence). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the difference at the amino acid level between two OspC types and their degree of association. Overall, the observed patterns suggest that facilitation is more important than competition in this system and that more diverse infections have an advantage in establishing and/or maintaining infection.

Yet for many wild organisms, age is an inaccessible trait. In many cases measuring age or ageing rates in the wild requires molecular biomarkers of age. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation have been shown to accurately estimate the age of humans and laboratory mice, but they also show variable ticking rates that are associated with mortality risk above and beyond that predicted by chronological age. Thus, epigenetic clocks are proving to be useful markers of both chronological and biological age, and they are beginning to be applied to wild mammals and birds.

"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans.

"['Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) are traditionally regarded as sister to the clade of terrestrial chelicerates (Arachnida). This hypothesis has been challenged by recent phylogenomic analyses,  but the non-monophyly of Arachnida has consistently been disregarded  as artifactual. We reevaluated the placement of Xiphosura among chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic dataset to date, expanding outgroup sampling and including data from whole genome sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in theplacement of some arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is apparent that the radiation of Arachnids is an old one and occurred over a brief  period of time, resulting in several consecutive short internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of incomplete lineage sorting  (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees  to explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were evaluated, as well as the effects of fast  evolving partitions and the dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that the placement of horseshoe crabs can not be explained by missing data, compositional biases, saturation, or incomplete  lineage sorting. Interrogation of the phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic arachnids comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long standing paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat. Future studies testing chelicerate relationships should approach the task with a sampling strategy where the monophyly of Arachnida is not held as the premise.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jesus A.', 'lastName': 'Ballesteros', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}, {'firstName': 'Prashant P.', 'lastName': 'Sharma', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2g1f4n5'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: A critical appraisal of the placement of Xiphosura (Chelicerata) with account of known sources of phylogenetic error']
"['Pathogen evasion of the host immune system is a key force driving extreme polymorphism in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although this gene family is well characterized in structure and function, there is still much debate surrounding the mechanisms by which MHC diversity is selectively maintained. Many studies have investigated relationships between MHC variation and specific pathogens, and have found mixed support for and against the hypotheses of heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection. Few, however, have focused on the selective effects of multiple parasite types on host immunogenetic patterns. Here, we examined relationships between variation in the equine MHC gene, ELA-DRA, and both gastrointestinal (GI) and ectoparasitism in plains zebras (Equus quagga). Specific alleles present at opposing population frequencies had antagonistic effects, with rare alleles associated with increased GI parasitism and common alleles with increased tick burdens. These results support a frequency-dependent mechanism, but are also consistent with fluctuating selection. Maladaptive GI parasite ‘susceptibility alleles’ were reduced in frequency, suggesting that these parasites may play a greater selective role at this locus. Heterozygote advantage, in terms of allele mutational divergence, also predicted decreased GI parasite burden in genotypes with a common allele. We conclude that an immunogenetic trade-off affects resistance/susceptibility to parasites in this system. Because GI and ectoparasites do not directly interact within hosts, our results uniquely show that antagonistic parasite interactions can be indirectly modulated through the host immune system. This study highlights the importance of investigating the role of multiple parasites in shaping patterns of host immunogenetic variation.']","[[{'firstName': 'Pauline L.', 'lastName': 'Kamath', 'email': 'pauline.kamath@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}, {'firstName': 'Wendy C.', 'lastName': 'Turner', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Martina', 'lastName': 'Küsters', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley Etosha Anthrax Research Project, Swakopmund, Namibia'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne M.', 'lastName': 'Getz', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p083b'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Parasite-mediated selection drives an immunogenetic tradeoff in plains zebras (Equus quagga)']

To study roles of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, bioinformatic and molecular approaches were carried out. MUMmer genome alignments of whole genome sequence of I. scapularis, a close relative to I. pacificus, against completely sequenced genomes of R. bellii OSU85-389, R. conorii, and R. felis, identified 8,190 unique sequences that are homologous to Rickettsia sequences in the NCBI Trace Archive. MetaCyc metabolic reconstructions revealed that all folate gene orthologues (folA, folC, folE, folKP, ptpS) required for de novo folate biosynthesis are present in the genome of Rickettsia buchneri in I. scapularis. To examine the metabolic capability of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, genes of the folate biosynthesis pathway of the bacterium were PCR amplified using degenerate primers. BLAST searches identified that nucleotide sequences of the folA, folC, folE, folKP, and ptpS genes possess 98.6%, 98.8%, 98.9%, 98.5% and 99.0% identity respectively to the corresponding genes of Rickettsia buchneri. Phylogenetic tree constructions show that the folate genes of phylotype G021 and homologous genes from various Rickettsia species are monophyletic.

"['The mechanisms underlying honest signal expression remain elusive and may involve the integration of social and physiological costs. Corticosterone is a socially modulated metabolic hormone that mediates energy investment and behavior and may therefore function to deter dishonest signal expression. We examined the relationship between corticosterone and green badge coloration in male sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), hypothesizing that physiological and behavioral costs resulting from elevated baseline glucocorticoids function in maintenance of honest signal expression. We found that large-badged males had higher corticosterone titer, with this relationship apparent at the end of the season and absent early in the season. Large-badged males also suffered higher ectoparasite load (number of tick nymphs), despite being in better condition than small-badged males. Ectoparasite load was positively related to corticosterone titer early in the season at the time of badge formation. High-condition individuals had lower corticosterone and lower numbers of ectoparasites than low-condition individuals, suggestive of conditional variation in ability to withstand costs of corticosterone. We found an opposing negative relationship between corticosterone titer and endoparasite load. Corticosterone titer was also negatively associated with male mobility, a fitness-determining behavior in this species. Because badge size is involved in mediating agonistic social interactions in this species, our results suggest that badge-dependent variation in corticosterone is likely reflective of variation in social conditions experienced over the course of the season. Our results implicate corticosterone in maintenance of signal honesty, both early in the season through enforcement of physiological costs (ectoparasite load) and during the season through behavioral costs (male mobility). We propose that socially modulated variation in corticosterone critically functions in mediation of signal honesty without requiring a direct role for corticosterone in trait expression.']","[[{'firstName': 'Willow R.', 'lastName': 'Lindsay', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Wapstra', 'affiliation': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01nfmeh72'}, {'firstName': 'Bengt', 'lastName': 'Silverin', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Mats', 'lastName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': 'University of Sydney', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/0384j8v12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.67136'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Corticosterone: a costly mediator of signal honesty in sand lizards']
"['The Near East cattle are adapted to different agro-ecological zones including desert areas, mountains habitats as well as humid regions along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers system.

Among these, the Jenoubi is found in the southern more humid part of Iraq while the Rustaqi is found in the middle and drier region of the country. Despite their importance, Iraqi cattle have up to now been poorly characterized at genome level. Here, we report at genome-wide level the diversity and signature of positive selection in these two breeds. Thirty-five unrelated Jenoubi cattle, sampled in the Maysan and Basra regions, and 60 Rustaqi cattle, from around Baghdad and Babylon, were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip (700K). Genetic population structure and diversity level were studied using principal component analysis (PCA), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and admixture. Signatures of selection were studied using Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) (iHS and Rsb) and inter-population Wright’s Fst. The results of PCA and admixture analysis, including European taurine, Asian indicine, African indicine and taurine indicate that the two breeds are crossbreed zebu x taurine, with more zebu background in Jenoubi cattle compared to Rustaqi. The Rustaqi has the greatest mean heterozygosity (He = 0.37) among all breeds. iHS and Rsb signature of selection analyses identify 68 candidate genes under positive selection in the two Iraqi breeds, while Fst analysis identifies 220 candidate genes including genes related to the innate and acquired immunity responses, different environmental selection pressures (e.g. tick resistance, heat stress) and genes of commercial interest (e.g. marbling score).']","[[{'firstName': 'Akil Farouk', 'lastName': 'Alshawi'}, {'firstName': 'Abdulameer', 'lastName': 'Essa'}, {'firstName': 'Sahar', 'lastName': 'Al-Bayatti'}, {'firstName': 'Olivier', 'lastName': 'Hanotte'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t35r32q'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Genome analysis reveals genetic admixture and signature of selection for productivity and environmental traits in Iraqi cattle']

"['<p><span style=""background:white;"">Habitat quality regulates fitness and population density, making it a key driver of population size. Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses “best available science”, extending inferences across taxa, space or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>),<i> </i>which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex tradeoff between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.</span></p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Amanda', 'lastName': 'Cheeseman', 'email': 'acheesem@esf.edu', 'affiliation': 'SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00qv0tw17', 'orcid': '0000-0002-3744-0945'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9khq'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Survival and density of New England cottontail and Eastern cottontail']
"['The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.']","[[{'firstName': 'Allison L.', 'lastName': 'Hicks', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}, {'firstName': 'Siobain', 'lastName': 'Duffy', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.58ss8'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Cell tropism predicts long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction. Our model suggests land use regulations that reduce parcel size would be an actionable approach for policy makers concerned about increasing Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern US.10-Oct-2018']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'Plantinga', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p7t9289'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Missing the people for the trees: identifying coupled natural-human system feedbacks driving the ecology of Lyme disease']
"['Background: Despite considerable effort, progress in spider molecular systematics has lagged behind many other comparable arthropod groups, thereby hindering family-level resolution, classification, and testing of important macroevolutionary hypotheses. Recently, alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches, Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE), is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome, for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders, with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Results: Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci, we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome, three published araneomorph spider genomes, and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit, we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa, 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa, 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus Aphonopelma (83 taxa, 581 loci). At the deepest level, all three major spider lineages (the Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae) were supported with high bootstrap support. Strong support was also found throughout the Euctenizidae, including generic relationships within the family and species relationships within the genus Aptostichus. As in the Euctenizidae, virtually identical topologies were inferred with high support throughout Aphonopelma. Conclusions: The Spider Probe Kit, the first implementation of AHE methodology in Class Arachnida, holds great promise for gathering the types and quantities of molecular data needed to accelerate an understanding of the spider Tree of Life by providing a mechanism whereby different researchers can confidently and effectively use the same loci for independent projects, yet allowing synthesis of data across independent research groups.']","[[{'firstName': 'Chris A.', 'lastName': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}, {'firstName': 'Alan R.', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Emily Moriarty', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Jason E.', 'lastName': 'Bond', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.5027d'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Expanding anchored hybrid enrichment to resolve both deep and shallow relationships within the spider tree of life']
"['Both large-wildlife loss and climatic changes can independently influence the prevalence and distribution of zoonotic disease. Given growing evidence that wildlife loss often has stronger community-level effects in low-productivity areas, we hypothesized that these perturbations would have interactive effects on disease risk. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by measuring tick abundance and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia spp.) within long-term, size-selective, large-herbivore exclosures replicated across a precipitation gradient in East Africa. Total wildlife exclusion increased total tick abundance by 130% (mesic sites) to 225% (dry, low-productivity sites), demonstrating a significant interaction of defaunation and aridity on tick abundance. When differing degrees of exclusion were tested for a subset of months, total tick abundance increased from 170% (only mega-herbivores excluded) to 360% (all large wildlife excluded). Wildlife exclusion differentially affected the abundance of the three dominant tick species, and this effect varied strongly over time, likely due to differences among species in their host associations, seasonality, and other ecological characteristics. Pathogen prevalence did not differ across wildlife exclusion treatments, rainfall levels, or tick species, suggesting that exposure risk will respond to defaunation and climate change in proportion to total tick abundance. These findings demonstrate interacting effects of defaunation and aridity that increase disease risk, and they highlight the need to incorporate ecological context when predicting effects of wildlife loss on zoonotic disease dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Georgia', 'lastName': 'Titcomb', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Brian F.', 'lastName': 'Allan', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Ainsworth', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Henson', 'lastName': 'Lauren', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Hedlund', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Robert M.', 'lastName': 'Pringle', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Todd M.', 'lastName': 'Palmer', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y3ad647'}, {'firstName': 'Laban', 'lastName': 'Njoroge', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Campana', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'Robert C.', 'lastName': 'Fleischer', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'John Naisikie', 'lastName': 'Mantas', 'affiliation': 'Mpala Research Center and Wildlife Foundation', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04c466w42'}, {'firstName': 'Hillary S.', 'lastName': 'Young', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Lauren', 'lastName': 'Henson', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.sf33k'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Interacting effects of wildlife loss and climate on ticks and tick-borne disease']

Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites, but was not related to host blood source.

The tick R. geigyi tends to be dominant, but occurs only in the four northern departments. The observations concerning R. microplus are entirely different, this species occurs in the southern and central region.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.']","[[{'firstName': 'Richard S.', 'lastName': 'Ostfeld', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Taal', 'lastName': 'Levi', 'affiliation': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00ysfqy60'}, {'firstName': 'Felicia', 'lastName': 'Keesing', 'affiliation': 'Bard College', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04yrgt058'}, {'firstName': 'Kelly', 'lastName': 'Oggenfuss', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Charles D.', 'lastName': 'Canham', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d1c8046'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tick-borne disease risk in a forest food web']
"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole.

In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens. We found that larval burden on two rodent species decreased with activity of two predator species, while DON and DIN for all three pathogens increased with larval burden on rodents, as predicted. Path analyses supported an indirect negative correlation of activity of both predator species with DON and DIN.

"['<p>Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards (<i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i>) are a key host to western black-legged ticks (<i>Ixodes pacificus</i>). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures or both. We infested males with larval ticks and staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits. There was also no effect of tick attachment location and hemoparasite infection on host contest behavior. This is the first demonstration of the impact of <i>I. pacificus</i> parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards, and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness.

"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']

Here, I show that the infectivity (probability of transmission) of the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii from two of its natural rodent hosts (bank vole and yellow-necked mouse) to its main tick vector increases asymptotically with increasing exploitation (measured as bacterial load in skin biopsies). Hence, this result provides support for one of the basic assumptions of the ‘trade-off hypothesis’. Moreover, there was no difference in infectivity between bank voles and yellow-necked mice despite bacterial loads being on average an order of magnitude higher in bank voles, most likely because ticks took larger blood meals from mice.

"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales. Moreover, we illustrate how species distribution models, in combination with temporally refined species occurrence and environmental data, can be used to investigate environmental factors predictive of geographic variation in seasonality or phenology of vector species. This produces not only novel ecological insight, but key information for public health practitioners in managing vector-borne disease transmission and targeting public outreach and interventions.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald'}, {'firstName': 'Craig', 'lastName': ""O'Neill""}, {'firstName': 'Melissa H.', 'lastName': 'Yoshimizu'}, {'firstName': 'Kerry A.', 'lastName': 'Padgett'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8769t44'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracking seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick across California']
"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones.

"['Exploring the microbial diversity of ticks is crucial to understand geographical dispersion and pathogen transmission. Tick microbes participate in many biological processes implicated in the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of pathogens, and actively promote host phenotypic changes, and adaptation to new environments. The microbial community of Ixodes ventalloi still remains unexplored. In this study, the bacterial microbiota of wild-caught I. ventalloi was characterized using shotgun-metagenomic sequencing in samples from unfed adults collected during December 2013-January 2014 in two locations from Sicily, Italy. The microbiota identified in I. ventalloi was mainly composed of symbiotic, commensal, and environmental bacteria. Interestingly, we identified the genera Anaplasma and Borrelia as members of the microbiota of I. ventalloi.

"['High-throughput sequencing is revealing that most macro-organisms house diverse microbial communities. Of particular interest are disease vectors whose microbiome could potentially affect pathogen transmission and vector competence. We investigated bacterial community composition and diversity of the ticks Dermacentor variabilis (n = 68) and Ixodes scapularis (n = 15) and blood of their shared rodent host, Peromyscus leucopus (n = 45) to quantify bacterial diversity and concordance. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs. Our results point to complex microbial assemblages inhabiting ticks and host blood including infectious agents, tick-specific endosymbionts and environmental bacteria that could potentially affect arthropod-vectored disease dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Evelyn C.', 'lastName': 'Rynkiewicz', 'affiliation': 'University of Edinburgh', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01nrxwf90'}, {'firstName': 'Chris', 'lastName': 'Hemmerich', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02k40bc56'}, {'firstName': 'Clay', 'lastName': 'Fuqua', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02k40bc56'}, {'firstName': 'Keith', 'lastName': 'Clay', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02k40bc56'}, {'firstName': 'Douglas B.', 'lastName': 'Rusch', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University Bloomington', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02k40bc56'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.gb538'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Concordance of bacterial communities of two tick species and blood of their shared rodent host']

Almost 1.4 million reads (average length : 528 nt) were generated with a full Roche 454 GS FLX run on two Reduced Representation Libraries of I. ricinus. 321,088 putative SNPs were isolated using the newly developed bioinformatics tool READ2SNPS, which identifies SNPs without requiring a reference genome. Stringent selection criteria were applied in a bioinformatics pipeline to select 1,768 SNPs for the development of specific primers. Among 384 randomly selected SNPs, tested by Fluidigm genotyping technology on 464 individual ticks, 368 SNPs loci (96%) exhibited the presence of the two expected alleles. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests conducted on 6 natural populations of ticks showed that from 26 to 46 of the 384 loci exhibited significant heterozygote deficiencies.

Here, we investigate if host specialization drives diversity at ospC (which encodes an immunodominant surface protein) in the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia afzelii. We determined prevalence and infection intensity of ospC strains in naturally infected wild mammals (rodents and shrews) by 454 amplicon sequencing in combination with qPCR. Neither prevalence nor infection intensity of specific ospC strains varied in a species-specific manner (i.e. there were no significant ospC × host species interactions). Rankings of ospC prevalences were strongly positively correlated across host species. Rankings of ospC infection intensities were correlated more weakly, but only in one case significantly less than 1. ospC prevalences in the studied mammals were similar to those in ticks sampled at the study site, indicating that we did not miss any mammal species that are important hosts for specific ospC strains. Based on this we conclude that there is at best limited host specialization in B. afzelii, and that other processes are likely the main drivers of ospC diversity.']","[[{'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Råberg', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Åsa', 'lastName': 'Hagström', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Martin', 'lastName': 'Andersson', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Simona', 'lastName': 'Bartkova', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Kristin', 'lastName': 'Scherman', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Maria', 'lastName': 'Strandh', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.fg475'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Evolution of antigenic diversity in the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia afzelii: a role for host specialization?']

We used a novel double digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (dd-RAD seq), and we discovered 8181 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 189 ticks from across the geographic range of the species. Overall, genetic diversity was lower than expected. Further, the edge populations did not have a statistically significant lower diversity than core populations, and hypotheses of range expansion are not supported by a test based on genetic data. Nonetheless, moderate levels of population structure were detected among geographic regions, with the northeast cluster the least variable.

"['Background: The prolonged feeding process of ixodid ticks, in combination with bacterial transmission, should lead to a robust inflammatory response at the blood-feeding site. Yet, factors present in tick saliva may down-regulate such responses, which may be beneficial to spirochete transmission. The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that tick saliva, in the context of Borrelia burgdorferi, can have widespread effects on the production of immune mediators in skin.  Methods: A cross-section of tick feeding on skin was examined histologically. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"[""1. Assessing the impacts of multiple, often synergistic, stressors on the population dynamics of long-lived species is becoming increasingly important due to recent and future global change. 2. Tiliqua rugosa (sleepy lizard) is a long-lived skink (>30 years) that is adapted to survive in semi-arid environments with varying levels of parasite exposure and highly seasonal food availability. We used an exhaustive database of 30-years of capture-mark-recapture records to quantify the impacts of both parasite exposure and environmental conditions on the lizard's survival rates and long-term population dynamics. 3. Lizard abundance was relatively stable throughout the study period; however there were changing patterns in adult and juvenile apparent survival rates, driven by spatial and temporal variation in levels of tick exposure and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Extreme weather events during the winter and spring seasons were identified as important environmental drivers of survival. 4. Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme hot and dry winter and spring seasons in our South Australian study region; from a contemporary probability of 0.17 up to 0.47 - 0.83 in 2080 depending on the emissions scenario. Our stochastic population model projections showed that these future climatic conditions will induce a decline in the abundance of this long-lived reptile of up to 67% within 30 years from 2080, under worst case scenario modelling. 5. The results have broad implications for future work investigating the drivers of population dynamics and persistence. We highlight the importance of long-term datasets and accounting for synergistic impacts between multiple stressors. We show that predicted increases in the frequency of extreme climate events have the potential to considerably and negatively influence a long-lived species, which might previously have been assumed to be resilient to environmental perturbations.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Alice R.', 'lastName': 'Jones', 'affiliation': 'University of Adelaide', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00892tw58'}, {'firstName': 'C.

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"
"['The endophilic tick Ixodes arboricola infests cavity-nesting birds, and its dispersal strongly depends on the movements of its host. Population genetic structure of I. arboricola was studied with seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. We collected 268 ticks from 76 nest boxes in four woodlots near Antwerp, Belgium. These nest boxes are mainly used by the principal hosts of I. arboricola, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. As these birds typically return to the same cavity for roosting or breeding, ticks within nest boxes were expected to be highly related, and tick populations were expected to be spatially structured among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. In line with the expectations, genetic population structure was found among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. Surprisingly, there was considerable genetic variation among ticks within nest boxes. This could be explained by continuous gene flow from ticks from nearby tree holes, yet this remains to be tested. A pairwise relatedness analysis conducted for all pairs of ticks within nest boxes showed that relatedness among larvae was much higher than among later instars, which suggests that larvae are the most important instar for tick dispersal. Overall, tick populations at the studied spatial scale are not as differentiated as predicted, which may influence the scale at which host–parasite evolution occurs.']","[[{'firstName': 'Kurt', 'lastName': 'Jordaens', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Backeljau', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'A.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

Ticks parasitize seabirds across all biogeographical regions and they can be particularly harmful to nestlings, but the ecological factors that affect their transmission to chicks are little studied and poorly understood. Here we show that abundance of tick larvae in blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) broods varies with local nest synchrony and density, and also with habitat structure: abundance increased with local breeding synchrony, was linearly and quadratically related to local nest density, and was highest toward the southern end of the study area which has suitable (boulder-rich) habitat for ticks. Also, with increasing chick age infestation first increased and then declined.

"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag. We highlight the important role of the genospecies’ pathogenicity and the host associations for understanding the epidemiology of disseminated Lyme borreliosis.']","[[{'firstName': 'Atle', 'lastName': 'Mysterud', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Dieter', 'lastName': 'Heylen', 'affiliation': 'University of Hasselt', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04nbhqj75'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Mathyssen', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Aïda', 'lastName': 'Garcia', 'affiliation': 'Lista Bird Observatory, 4563 Borhaug, Norway'}, {'firstName': 'Solveig', 'lastName': 'Jore', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Institute of Public Health', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/046nvst19'}, {'firstName': 'Hildegunn', 'lastName': 'Viljugrein', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.c7q3n2c'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Lyme neuroborreliosis and bird populations in northern Europe']

The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach—occupancy modelling—to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases.

"['Historical patterns of dispersal and population isolation are key components shaping contemporary genetic diversity across landscapes and require explicit consideration when examining the relative role of different factors in driving the evolution of host specificity in parasitic organisms. In this study, we investigate the worldwide colonisation history of a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae. This tick has a circumpolar distribution across both hemispheres, but has repeatedly formed host-specific races within different regions. By combining mitochondrial and nuclear data, we infer how this species spread to its present-day distribution and how the colonisation process has affected the geographic and host-associated structure of this tick within regions. We demonstrate that I. uriae is highly structured and isolates into four genetic groups that correspond to well-defined geographical regions. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification of I. uriae began in the early Miocene (22 Myr) and that this tick colonised most of the Southern hemisphere before moving into northern latitudes via two independent routes. However, no relationship between the degree of host race divergence and colonisation history was evident, supporting previous hypotheses that host specialization evolves relatively rapidly in this parasite, but does not typically lead to speciation. We discuss the possible historical and contemporary mechanisms of large scale dispersal for this ectoparasite and how its biological characteristics may condition current patterns of genetic diversity. More generally, our results illustrate how combining broad-scale sampling and modern molecular tools can help disentangle complex patterns of diversification in widespread parasites.']","[[{'firstName': 'Muriel', 'lastName': 'Dietrich', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Florent', 'lastName': 'Kempf', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Boulinier', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive"", 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008rywf59'}, {'firstName': 'Karen D.', 'lastName': 'McCoy', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.ff71n'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracing the colonization and diversification of the worldwide seabird ectoparasite Ixodes uriae']

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that the vector microbiome can impact pathogen dynamics, making the microbiome a focal point in vector-borne disease ecology. However, efforts to generalize preliminary findings across studies and systems and translate these findings into disease control strategies are hindered by a lack of fundamental understanding of the processes shaping the vector microbiome and the interactions therein. Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing and apply a community ecology framework to analyze microbiome community assembly and interactions in Ixodes pacificus, the Lyme disease vector in the western US. We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia. At the scale of the individual I. pacificus, we find support for a highly limited internal microbial community, and propose that the tick endosymbiont may be the most important component of the vector microbiome in influencing pathogen dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Lisa I.', 'lastName': 'Couper'}, {'firstName': 'Jessica Y.', 'lastName': 'Kwan'}, {'firstName': 'Joyce', 'lastName': 'Ma'}, {'firstName': 'Andrea', 'lastName': 'Swei'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2nv32qh'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Drivers and patterns of microbial community assembly in a Lyme disease vector']
"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l.

We included ticks from some sympatric flighted seabirds to verify host-specificity. Results We resolved two distinct lineages of Ixodes from little penguins, with one restricted to Australia, and the other found throughout New Zealand and in low numbers at some eastern Australian sites. Both lineages exhibited phylogeographic structure consistent with patterns observed in their hosts, with some evidence of occasional oceanic dispersal, including across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Ticks from sympatric short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), which disperse aerially, were genetically distinct from those collected from little penguins, supporting prior evidence of host-specificity in seabird ticks.

"['The seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) parasitizes over 60 host species in the circumpolar regions of both hemispheres, and acts as a vector for a number of potentially virulent pathogens. On Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, the nestlings of Cassin’s Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) are often parasitized by seabird ticks, which may affect their growth and survival in the nest. We used a logistic growth model to interpolate between successive measures of mass (g) and wing chord (mm) for 558 Cassin’s Auklet and 344 Rhinoceros Auklet chicks over 11 years from 1996 to 2007. From the model, we estimated the asymptotic measure and the age at inflection point for each chick’s growth trajectory, and assessed the effect of tick load relative to other sources of annual and seasonal variation in growth. Most chicks (72.4% of Cassin’s Auklets, and 62.2% of Rhinoceros Auklets) hosted ≥1 ticks at least once while in the nest, and the median tick load was two in both species. The probability of hosting a tick declined strongly with chick age, such that by day 40 after hatching less than 1% hosted ticks. We found evidence that tick load had a negative effect on asymptotic weights and wing lengths of both species, but the effect was minor relative to that of other sources of annual and seasonal variation. Only at very high loads – which were rare – did ticks have effects on growth that were likely to be biologically relevant. Tick load had little effect on survival to fledging in either species.We argue that these mild effects of ticks on their hosts are consistent with a co-evolutionary process that results in intermediate virulence when parasite transmission is linked to host recovery.']","[[{'firstName': 'J.

"['Zoonotic pathogens that cause devastating morbidity and mortality in humans may be relatively harmless in their natural reservoir hosts. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in humans but few studies have investigated whether this pathogen reduces the fitness of its reservoir hosts under natural conditions. We analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data on a population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, to test whether B. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. B. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector. The estimates of B. burgdorferi infection risk will facilitate future theoretical studies on the epidemiology of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Maarten J.', 'lastName': 'Voordouw', 'affiliation': 'University of Pennsylvania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00b30xv10'}, {'firstName': 'Shelly', 'lastName': 'Lachish', 'affiliation': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/052gg0110'}, {'firstName': 'Marc C.', 'lastName': 'Dolan', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/042twtr12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8bq31'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The Lyme disease pathogen has no effect on the survival of its rodent reservoir host']
"['Individual hosts vary substantially in their parasite loads. However, whether individual hosts have consistently different loads remains uncertain. If so, hosts that have <i>consistently</i> high parasite loads may serve as key reservoirs or super-spreaders. Thus, identifying whether individuals persistently differ in their parasitism and the factors that explain these patterns constitute important issues for disease ecology and management. To investigate these topics, we examined nine years of tick counts in a wild population of sleepy lizards, <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>. Lizards were individually marked, and throughout their activity season, often across several years, we repeatedly assessed lizards’ ticks (to stage – larva, nymph, adult male, and adult female – and species, either <i>Bothriocroton hydrosauri</i> or <i>Amblyomma limbatum</i>). Using these repeated individual measures, we determined whether tick counts were repeatable. Then, we tested predictors of average tick counts, particularly lizard mass, sex, behavioural type (aggression and boldness), and the distance between lizards’ home range centre and a road transecting the study site (an area of greater food and lizard activity). We found that lizards exhibited consistent individual differences in tick loads both within and across years. Within-lizard yearly average counts of larvae and nymphs were positively correlated. Lizards closer to the road tended to have more larvae and nymphs of both species and more adult <i>B. hydrosauri</i>. Sex did not affect tick counts. Mass differentially affected adult female <i>A. limbatum</i> and adult male <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts. Intriguingly, lizards with above average aggression but below average boldness, or vice versa, tended to have higher average adult female <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that lizards differed consistently in their tick counts, indicating that lizard parasitism may constitute a phenotypic trait of the individual, with implications for both host-parasite dynamics and broader host ecology.']","[[{'firstName': 'Eric', 'lastName': 'Payne', 'email': 'empayne@ucdavis.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rrcem69', 'orcid': '0000-0002-0730-0837'}, {'firstName': 'David', 'lastName': 'Sinn', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rrcem69'}, {'firstName': 'Orr', 'lastName': 'Spiegel', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Tel Aviv University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04mhzgx49'}, {'firstName': 'Stephan', 'lastName': 'Leu', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'University of Adelaide', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00892tw58'}, {'firstName': 'Caroline', 'lastName': 'Wohlfeil', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}, {'firstName': 'Stephanie', 'lastName': 'Godfrey', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'University of Otago', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01jmxt844'}, {'firstName': 'Michael', 'lastName': 'Gardner', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Sih', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Davis', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rrcem69'}]]",['doi:10.25338/B8B310'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Consistent individual differences in ecto-parasitism of a long-lived lizard host']
"['<p>1.) The species interactions that structure natural communities are increasingly disrupted by radical habitat change resulting from the widespread processes of urbanization and species translocations.

Often the same species that benefit from urbanization are successful invaders in introduced habitats, suggesting that similar processes promote these species in both environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.) Both processes may especially benefit certain species by modifying their interactions with harmful parasites (“enemy release”). To detect such modifications, we first need to identify the mechanisms underlying host-parasite associations in natural populations, then test whether they are disrupted in cities and introduced habitats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.) We studied the interaction between the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>), a globally invasive species native to South America, and its <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks. Our field study of 642 cane toads across 46 sites within their native range in French Guiana revealed that 56% of toads carried ticks, and that toads with ticks were in poor body condition relative to uninfected conspecifics. Across natural and disturbed habitats, tick prevalence and abundance increased with toad density, but this association was disrupted in the urban environment, where tick abundance remained low even where toad densities were high, and prevalence decreased with density.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.) Reductions in the abundance of ticks in urban habitats may be attributable to pesticides (which are sprayed for mosquito control, but are also lethal to ticks), and our literature review shows that tick abundance is generally lower in cane toads from urban habitats across South America.

"['Urban species encounter resources that are uncommon in nature, such as materials found in city waste. Many studies have shown that these can be harmful to wildlife. In Mexico City, house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which reduces the amount of ectoparasites, but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet, the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively, disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches Carpodacus mexicanus increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present, fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away, we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest, as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched, and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks, 2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation. It seems that the tendency to bring to the nest cigarette butts is at least partially a response to current, and perhaps also past, parasite load.']","[[{'firstName': 'Monserrat', 'lastName': 'Suárez-Rodríguez', 'affiliation': 'National Autonomous University of Mexico', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01tmp8f25'}, {'firstName': 'Constantino Macías', 'lastName': 'Garcia', 'affiliation': 'National Autonomous University of Mexico', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01tmp8f25'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6nt07'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: An experimental demonstration that house finches add cigarette butts in response to ectoparasites']

Vector distribution and host infection risk were estimated over the study area and subsequently tested as triggers of local adaptation by means of landscape genomics analysis. We identified 41 and seven candidate adaptive loci for tick resistance and infection tolerance, respectively. Among the genes associated with the candidate adaptive loci are PRKG1 and SLA2. PRKG1 was already described as associated with tick resistance in indigenous South African cattle, due to its role into inflammatory response.

We investigated the association between the load of ticks, which were used as a proxy for the load of pathogens they transmit, and MHC class I polymorphism across populations in two types of habitat: undisturbed reserves and agricultural land. We hypothesized that the association would be positive across undisturbed reserve populations, but across fragmented agricultural land populations the relationship would be distorted by the loss of MHC variation due to drift. After controlling for habitat, MHC diversity was not associated with tick number, and the habitats did not differ in this respect. Neither did we detect a difference between habitats in the relationship between MHC and neutral diversity, which was positive across all populations. However, there was extensive variation in the number of MHC alleles per individual, and we found that tick number was positively associated with the average number of alleles carried by lizards across reserve populations, but not across populations from disturbed agricultural land.

However, differences between classes of vector (e.g., ticks and insects) can cause discrepancies in epidemiological responses to environmental change. Using a pair of disease models (mosquito- and tick-borne), we simulated substitutive and additive biodiversity change (where noncompetent hosts replaced or were added to competent hosts, respectively), while considering different relationships between vector and host densities. We found important differences between classes of vector, including an increased likelihood of amplified disease risk under additive biodiversity change in mosquito models, driven by higher vector biting rates. We also draw attention to more general phenomena, such as a negative relationship between initial infection prevalence in vectors and likelihood of dilution, and the potential for a rise in density of infected vectors to occur simultaneously with a decline in proportion of infected hosts. This has important implications; the density of infected vectors is the most valid metric for primarily zoonotic infections, while the proportion of infected hosts is more relevant for infections where humans are a primary host.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew David MacEwan', 'lastName': 'Dobson'}, {'firstName': 'Stuart K.

The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. selection) may be different depending on loci considered.

Non-avian reptiles are under-represented within the MHC literature and little is understood regarding the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in this vertebrate group. Here, we examined the relative roles of parasite-mediated selection and sexual selection in maintaining MHC class I diversity of a colour polymorphic lizard. We discovered evidence for parasite-mediated selection acting via rare-allele advantage or fluctuating selection as ectoparasite load was significantly lower in the presence of a specific MHC supertype (functional clustering of alleles); supertype four. Based on comparisons between ectoparasite prevalence and load, and assessment of the impact of ectoparasite load on host fitness, we suggest that supertype four confers quantitative resistance to ticks or an intracellular tick-borne parasite. We found no evidence for MHC-associated mating in terms of pair genetic distance, number of alleles or specific supertypes . An association was uncovered between supertype four and male throat colour morph. However, it is unlikely that male throat colouration acts as a signal of MHC genotype to conspecifics because we found no evidence to suggest that male throat colouration predicts male mating status. Overall, our results suggest that parasite-mediated selection plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in this population via rare allele advantage and/or fluctuating selection.

Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status.

Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair.

We measured overall infection intensity with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and resolved the composition of multiple infections using strain-specific PCR assays targeting the ospC gene (which encodes an immunodominant surface protein). We found seven different strains, as defined by ospC genotype. There was little evidence for interactions affecting infection intensities, but strains were highly aggregated (i.e., there were more multiple infections than expected from random co-occurrence). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the difference at the amino acid level between two OspC types and their degree of association.

Yet for many wild organisms, age is an inaccessible trait. In many cases measuring age or ageing rates in the wild requires molecular biomarkers of age. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation have been shown to accurately estimate the age of humans and laboratory mice, but they also show variable ticking rates that are associated with mortality risk above and beyond that predicted by chronological age. Thus, epigenetic clocks are proving to be useful markers of both chronological and biological age, and they are beginning to be applied to wild mammals and birds.

Our wood mouse epigenetic clock is PCR-based, and so requires tiny amounts of tissue and non-destructive sampling. We quantified methylation using Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology and present a new bioinformatics pipeline for data analysis.

"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans.

In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles.

We reevaluated the placement of Xiphosura among chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic dataset to date, expanding outgroup sampling and including data from whole genome sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in theplacement of some arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is apparent that the radiation of Arachnids is an old one and occurred over a brief  period of time, resulting in several consecutive short internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of incomplete lineage sorting  (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees  to explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were evaluated, as well as the effects of fast  evolving partitions and the dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that the placement of horseshoe crabs can not be explained by missing data, compositional biases, saturation, or incomplete  lineage sorting. Interrogation of the phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic arachnids comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long standing paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat.

"['Pathogen evasion of the host immune system is a key force driving extreme polymorphism in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although this gene family is well characterized in structure and function, there is still much debate surrounding the mechanisms by which MHC diversity is selectively maintained. Many studies have investigated relationships between MHC variation and specific pathogens, and have found mixed support for and against the hypotheses of heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection. Few, however, have focused on the selective effects of multiple parasite types on host immunogenetic patterns. Here, we examined relationships between variation in the equine MHC gene, ELA-DRA, and both gastrointestinal (GI) and ectoparasitism in plains zebras (Equus quagga). Specific alleles present at opposing population frequencies had antagonistic effects, with rare alleles associated with increased GI parasitism and common alleles with increased tick burdens. These results support a frequency-dependent mechanism, but are also consistent with fluctuating selection. Maladaptive GI parasite ‘susceptibility alleles’ were reduced in frequency, suggesting that these parasites may play a greater selective role at this locus. Heterozygote advantage, in terms of allele mutational divergence, also predicted decreased GI parasite burden in genotypes with a common allele. We conclude that an immunogenetic trade-off affects resistance/susceptibility to parasites in this system. Because GI and ectoparasites do not directly interact within hosts, our results uniquely show that antagonistic parasite interactions can be indirectly modulated through the host immune system. This study highlights the importance of investigating the role of multiple parasites in shaping patterns of host immunogenetic variation.']","[[{'firstName': 'Pauline L.', 'lastName': 'Kamath', 'email': 'pauline.kamath@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}, {'firstName': 'Wendy C.', 'lastName': 'Turner', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Martina', 'lastName': 'Küsters', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley Etosha Anthrax Research Project, Swakopmund, Namibia'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne M.', 'lastName': 'Getz', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p083b'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Parasite-mediated selection drives an immunogenetic tradeoff in plains zebras (Equus quagga)']

To examine the metabolic capability of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, genes of the folate biosynthesis pathway of the bacterium were PCR amplified using degenerate primers. BLAST searches identified that nucleotide sequences of the folA, folC, folE, folKP, and ptpS genes possess 98.6%, 98.8%, 98.9%, 98.5% and 99.0% identity respectively to the corresponding genes of Rickettsia buchneri. Phylogenetic tree constructions show that the folate genes of phylotype G021 and homologous genes from various Rickettsia species are monophyletic. This study has shown that all folate genes exist in the genome of Rickettsia species phylotype G021 and that this bacterium has the genetic capability for de novo folate synthesis.']","[[{'firstName': 'Daniel J.', 'lastName': 'Hunter', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'Jessica L.', 'lastName': 'Torkelson', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'James', 'lastName': 'Bodnar', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'Bobak', 'lastName': 'Mortazavi'}, {'firstName': 'Timothy', 'lastName': 'Laurent', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'Jeff', 'lastName': 'Deason', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'Khanhkeo', 'lastName': 'Thephavongsa', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}, {'firstName': 'Jianmin', 'lastName': 'Zhong', 'affiliation': 'Humboldt State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qt0xs84'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2jc88'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes pacificus contains all the genes of de novo folate biosynthesis']
"['The mechanisms underlying honest signal expression remain elusive and may involve the integration of social and physiological costs. Corticosterone is a socially modulated metabolic hormone that mediates energy investment and behavior and may therefore function to deter dishonest signal expression. We examined the relationship between corticosterone and green badge coloration in male sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), hypothesizing that physiological and behavioral costs resulting from elevated baseline glucocorticoids function in maintenance of honest signal expression. We found that large-badged males had higher corticosterone titer, with this relationship apparent at the end of the season and absent early in the season. Large-badged males also suffered higher ectoparasite load (number of tick nymphs), despite being in better condition than small-badged males. Ectoparasite load was positively related to corticosterone titer early in the season at the time of badge formation. High-condition individuals had lower corticosterone and lower numbers of ectoparasites than low-condition individuals, suggestive of conditional variation in ability to withstand costs of corticosterone. We found an opposing negative relationship between corticosterone titer and endoparasite load. Corticosterone titer was also negatively associated with male mobility, a fitness-determining behavior in this species. Because badge size is involved in mediating agonistic social interactions in this species, our results suggest that badge-dependent variation in corticosterone is likely reflective of variation in social conditions experienced over the course of the season. Our results implicate corticosterone in maintenance of signal honesty, both early in the season through enforcement of physiological costs (ectoparasite load) and during the season through behavioral costs (male mobility). We propose that socially modulated variation in corticosterone critically functions in mediation of signal honesty without requiring a direct role for corticosterone in trait expression.']","[[{'firstName': 'Willow R.', 'lastName': 'Lindsay', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Wapstra', 'affiliation': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01nfmeh72'}, {'firstName': 'Bengt', 'lastName': 'Silverin', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Mats', 'lastName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': 'University of Sydney', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/0384j8v12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.67136'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Corticosterone: a costly mediator of signal honesty in sand lizards']
"['The Near East cattle are adapted to different agro-ecological zones including desert areas, mountains habitats as well as humid regions along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers system. The region was one of the earliest and most significant areas of cattle husbandry. Currently four main breeds of Iraqi cattle are recognized. Among these, the Jenoubi is found in the southern more humid part of Iraq while the Rustaqi is found in the middle and drier region of the country. Despite their importance, Iraqi cattle have up to now been poorly characterized at genome level. Here, we report at genome-wide level the diversity and signature of positive selection in these two breeds. Thirty-five unrelated Jenoubi cattle, sampled in the Maysan and Basra regions, and 60 Rustaqi cattle, from around Baghdad and Babylon, were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip (700K). Genetic population structure and diversity level were studied using principal component analysis (PCA), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and admixture. Signatures of selection were studied using Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) (iHS and Rsb) and inter-population Wright’s Fst. The results of PCA and admixture analysis, including European taurine, Asian indicine, African indicine and taurine indicate that the two breeds are crossbreed zebu x taurine, with more zebu background in Jenoubi cattle compared to Rustaqi. The Rustaqi has the greatest mean heterozygosity (He = 0.37) among all breeds. iHS and Rsb signature of selection analyses identify 68 candidate genes under positive selection in the two Iraqi breeds, while Fst analysis identifies 220 candidate genes including genes related to the innate and acquired immunity responses, different environmental selection pressures (e.g. tick resistance, heat stress) and genes of commercial interest (e.g. marbling score).']","[[{'firstName': 'Akil Farouk', 'lastName': 'Alshawi'}, {'firstName': 'Abdulameer', 'lastName': 'Essa'}, {'firstName': 'Sahar', 'lastName': 'Al-Bayatti'}, {'firstName': 'Olivier', 'lastName': 'Hanotte'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t35r32q'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Genome analysis reveals genetic admixture and signature of selection for productivity and environmental traits in Iraqi cattle']

"['<p><span style=""background:white;"">Habitat quality regulates fitness and population density, making it a key driver of population size. Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses “best available science”, extending inferences across taxa, space or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>),<i> </i>which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex tradeoff between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.</span></p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Amanda', 'lastName': 'Cheeseman', 'email': 'acheesem@esf.edu', 'affiliation': 'SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00qv0tw17', 'orcid': '0000-0002-3744-0945'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9khq'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Survival and density of New England cottontail and Eastern cottontail']
"['The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.']","[[{'firstName': 'Allison L.', 'lastName': 'Hicks', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}, {'firstName': 'Siobain', 'lastName': 'Duffy', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.58ss8'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Cell tropism predicts long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction. Our model suggests land use regulations that reduce parcel size would be an actionable approach for policy makers concerned about increasing Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern US.10-Oct-2018']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'Plantinga', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p7t9289'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Missing the people for the trees: identifying coupled natural-human system feedbacks driving the ecology of Lyme disease']
"['Background: Despite considerable effort, progress in spider molecular systematics has lagged behind many other comparable arthropod groups, thereby hindering family-level resolution, classification, and testing of important macroevolutionary hypotheses. Recently, alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches, Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE), is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome, for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders, with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Results: Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci, we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome, three published araneomorph spider genomes, and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit, we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa, 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa, 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus Aphonopelma (83 taxa, 581 loci). At the deepest level, all three major spider lineages (the Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae) were supported with high bootstrap support. Strong support was also found throughout the Euctenizidae, including generic relationships within the family and species relationships within the genus Aptostichus. As in the Euctenizidae, virtually identical topologies were inferred with high support throughout Aphonopelma. Conclusions: The Spider Probe Kit, the first implementation of AHE methodology in Class Arachnida, holds great promise for gathering the types and quantities of molecular data needed to accelerate an understanding of the spider Tree of Life by providing a mechanism whereby different researchers can confidently and effectively use the same loci for independent projects, yet allowing synthesis of data across independent research groups.']","[[{'firstName': 'Chris A.', 'lastName': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}, {'firstName': 'Alan R.', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Emily Moriarty', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Jason E.', 'lastName': 'Bond', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.5027d'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Expanding anchored hybrid enrichment to resolve both deep and shallow relationships within the spider tree of life']

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"

Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"
"['Both large-wildlife loss and climatic changes can independently influence the prevalence and distribution of zoonotic disease. Given growing evidence that wildlife loss often has stronger community-level effects in low-productivity areas, we hypothesized that these perturbations would have interactive effects on disease risk. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by measuring tick abundance and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia spp.) within long-term, size-selective, large-herbivore exclosures replicated across a precipitation gradient in East Africa. Total wildlife exclusion increased total tick abundance by 130% (mesic sites) to 225% (dry, low-productivity sites), demonstrating a significant interaction of defaunation and aridity on tick abundance. When differing degrees of exclusion were tested for a subset of months, total tick abundance increased from 170% (only mega-herbivores excluded) to 360% (all large wildlife excluded). Wildlife exclusion differentially affected the abundance of the three dominant tick species, and this effect varied strongly over time, likely due to differences among species in their host associations, seasonality, and other ecological characteristics. Pathogen prevalence did not differ across wildlife exclusion treatments, rainfall levels, or tick species, suggesting that exposure risk will respond to defaunation and climate change in proportion to total tick abundance. These findings demonstrate interacting effects of defaunation and aridity that increase disease risk, and they highlight the need to incorporate ecological context when predicting effects of wildlife loss on zoonotic disease dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Georgia', 'lastName': 'Titcomb', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Brian F.', 'lastName': 'Allan', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Ainsworth', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Henson', 'lastName': 'Lauren', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Hedlund', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Robert M.', 'lastName': 'Pringle', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Todd M.', 'lastName': 'Palmer', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y3ad647'}, {'firstName': 'Laban', 'lastName': 'Njoroge', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Campana', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'Robert C.', 'lastName': 'Fleischer', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'John Naisikie', 'lastName': 'Mantas', 'affiliation': 'Mpala Research Center and Wildlife Foundation', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04c466w42'}, {'firstName': 'Hillary S.', 'lastName': 'Young', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Lauren', 'lastName': 'Henson', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.sf33k'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Interacting effects of wildlife loss and climate on ticks and tick-borne disease']

Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics), or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of Neotropical ticks, collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites, but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. <i>Francisella </i>and <i>Rickettsia </i>were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species and we found both positive and negative co-occurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g. <i>Coxiella</i>, <i>Rickettsiella</i>) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected <i>Anaplasma</i> and <i>Bartonella </i>in several tick species.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.']","[[{'firstName': 'Richard S.', 'lastName': 'Ostfeld', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Taal', 'lastName': 'Levi', 'affiliation': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00ysfqy60'}, {'firstName': 'Felicia', 'lastName': 'Keesing', 'affiliation': 'Bard College', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04yrgt058'}, {'firstName': 'Kelly', 'lastName': 'Oggenfuss', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Charles D.', 'lastName': 'Canham', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d1c8046'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tick-borne disease risk in a forest food web']
"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.

In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived.

In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens. We found that larval burden on two rodent species decreased with activity of two predator species, while DON and DIN for all three pathogens increased with larval burden on rodents, as predicted. Path analyses supported an indirect negative correlation of activity of both predator species with DON and DIN.

"['<p>Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted.

We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures or both. We infested males with larval ticks and staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits.

"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']
"['The ‘trade-off’ hypothesis for virulence evolution assumes that between-host transmission rate is a positive and saturating function of pathogen exploitation and virulence, but there are as yet few tests of this assumption, in particular for vector-borne pathogens. Here, I show that the infectivity (probability of transmission) of the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii from two of its natural rodent hosts (bank vole and yellow-necked mouse) to its main tick vector increases asymptotically with increasing exploitation (measured as bacterial load in skin biopsies). Hence, this result provides support for one of the basic assumptions of the ‘trade-off hypothesis’. Moreover, there was no difference in infectivity between bank voles and yellow-necked mice despite bacterial loads being on average an order of magnitude higher in bank voles, most likely because ticks took larger blood meals from mice. This shows that interspecific variation in host resistance does not necessarily translate into a difference in infectivity.']","[[{'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Råberg', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.066v4476'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Infection intensity and infectivity of the tick-borne pathogen Borrelia afzelii']
"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales. Moreover, we illustrate how species distribution models, in combination with temporally refined species occurrence and environmental data, can be used to investigate environmental factors predictive of geographic variation in seasonality or phenology of vector species. This produces not only novel ecological insight, but key information for public health practitioners in managing vector-borne disease transmission and targeting public outreach and interventions.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald'}, {'firstName': 'Craig', 'lastName': ""O'Neill""}, {'firstName': 'Melissa H.', 'lastName': 'Yoshimizu'}, {'firstName': 'Kerry A.', 'lastName': 'Padgett'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8769t44'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracking seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick across California']
"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']
"['<p>Ecological factors and individual-specific traits affect parasite infestation in wild animals. We studied various key ecological variables (breeding density, human disturbance) and phenotypic traits (exploratory behaviour, body condition) proposed to predict tick infestation probability and burden in great tits (<i>Parus major</i>). Our study spanned three years and 12 nest-box plots located in southern Germany. Adult breeders were assessed for exploration behaviour, body condition, and tick burden. Plots were open to human recreation; human disturbance was quantified in each plot as a recreation pressure index from biweekly nest box inspections. Infested individuals were repeatable in tick burden across years. These repeatable among-individual differences in tick burden were not attributable to exploration behaviour. However, faster explorers did have a higher infestation probability. Furthermore, body condition negatively correlated to tick burden. Recreation pressure also tended to increase infestation probability. Our study implies that avian infestation probability and tick burden are each governed by distinct phenotypic traits and ecological factors.

"['Nonhuman primate species spend a conspicuous amount of time grooming during social interactions, a behaviour that probably serves both social and health-related functions. While the social implications of grooming have been relatively well studied, less attention has been paid to the health benefits, especially the removal of ectoparasites, which may act as vectors in disease transmission. In this study, we examined whether grooming behaviour reduced tick load (number of ticks) and haemoprotozoan infection status in a population of wild adult baboons (Papio cynocephalus). We found that younger and higher-ranking adults were groomed more often than older, low-ranking adults, and females were groomed more often than males. Animals that received more grooming, in turn, had lower tick loads. Baboons with lower tick loads had higher packed red cell volume (PCV or haematocrit), one general measure of health status. We detected a tick-borne haemoprotozoan, Babesia microti, but its low prevalence in the population precluded identifying sources of variance in infection.']","[[{'firstName': 'Mercy Y.', 'lastName': 'Akinyi', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Susan C.', 'lastName': 'Alberts', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Jeanne', 'lastName': 'Altmann', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Nilesh B.', 'lastName': 'Patel', 'affiliation': 'University of Nairobi', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y9nww90'}, {'firstName': 'Jenny', 'lastName': 'Tung', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Maamun', 'lastName': 'Jeneby', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3r8n2'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Role of grooming in reducing tick load in wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus)']

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"[""1. Assessing the impacts of multiple, often synergistic, stressors on the population dynamics of long-lived species is becoming increasingly important due to recent and future global change. 2. Tiliqua rugosa (sleepy lizard) is a long-lived skink (>30 years) that is adapted to survive in semi-arid environments with varying levels of parasite exposure and highly seasonal food availability. We used an exhaustive database of 30-years of capture-mark-recapture records to quantify the impacts of both parasite exposure and environmental conditions on the lizard's survival rates and long-term population dynamics. 3. Lizard abundance was relatively stable throughout the study period; however there were changing patterns in adult and juvenile apparent survival rates, driven by spatial and temporal variation in levels of tick exposure and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Extreme weather events during the winter and spring seasons were identified as important environmental drivers of survival. 4. Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme hot and dry winter and spring seasons in our South Australian study region; from a contemporary probability of 0.17 up to 0.47 - 0.83 in 2080 depending on the emissions scenario. Our stochastic population model projections showed that these future climatic conditions will induce a decline in the abundance of this long-lived reptile of up to 67% within 30 years from 2080, under worst case scenario modelling. 5. The results have broad implications for future work investigating the drivers of population dynamics and persistence. We highlight the importance of long-term datasets and accounting for synergistic impacts between multiple stressors. We show that predicted increases in the frequency of extreme climate events have the potential to considerably and negatively influence a long-lived species, which might previously have been assumed to be resilient to environmental perturbations.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Alice R.', 'lastName': 'Jones', 'affiliation': 'University of Adelaide', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00892tw58'}, {'firstName': 'C.

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"
"['The endophilic tick Ixodes arboricola infests cavity-nesting birds, and its dispersal strongly depends on the movements of its host. Population genetic structure of I. arboricola was studied with seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. We collected 268 ticks from 76 nest boxes in four woodlots near Antwerp, Belgium. These nest boxes are mainly used by the principal hosts of I. arboricola, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. As these birds typically return to the same cavity for roosting or breeding, ticks within nest boxes were expected to be highly related, and tick populations were expected to be spatially structured among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. In line with the expectations, genetic population structure was found among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. Surprisingly, there was considerable genetic variation among ticks within nest boxes. This could be explained by continuous gene flow from ticks from nearby tree holes, yet this remains to be tested. A pairwise relatedness analysis conducted for all pairs of ticks within nest boxes showed that relatedness among larvae was much higher than among later instars, which suggests that larvae are the most important instar for tick dispersal. Overall, tick populations at the studied spatial scale are not as differentiated as predicted, which may influence the scale at which host–parasite evolution occurs.']","[[{'firstName': 'Kurt', 'lastName': 'Jordaens', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Backeljau', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'A.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

Here we show that abundance of tick larvae in blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) broods varies with local nest synchrony and density, and also with habitat structure: abundance increased with local breeding synchrony, was linearly and quadratically related to local nest density, and was highest toward the southern end of the study area which has suitable (boulder-rich) habitat for ticks.

"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag.

Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved.

"['Historical patterns of dispersal and population isolation are key components shaping contemporary genetic diversity across landscapes and require explicit consideration when examining the relative role of different factors in driving the evolution of host specificity in parasitic organisms. In this study, we investigate the worldwide colonisation history of a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae. This tick has a circumpolar distribution across both hemispheres, but has repeatedly formed host-specific races within different regions. By combining mitochondrial and nuclear data, we infer how this species spread to its present-day distribution and how the colonisation process has affected the geographic and host-associated structure of this tick within regions. We demonstrate that I. uriae is highly structured and isolates into four genetic groups that correspond to well-defined geographical regions. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification of I. uriae began in the early Miocene (22 Myr) and that this tick colonised most of the Southern hemisphere before moving into northern latitudes via two independent routes. However, no relationship between the degree of host race divergence and colonisation history was evident, supporting previous hypotheses that host specialization evolves relatively rapidly in this parasite, but does not typically lead to speciation. We discuss the possible historical and contemporary mechanisms of large scale dispersal for this ectoparasite and how its biological characteristics may condition current patterns of genetic diversity. More generally, our results illustrate how combining broad-scale sampling and modern molecular tools can help disentangle complex patterns of diversification in widespread parasites.']","[[{'firstName': 'Muriel', 'lastName': 'Dietrich', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Florent', 'lastName': 'Kempf', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Boulinier', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive"", 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008rywf59'}, {'firstName': 'Karen D.', 'lastName': 'McCoy', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.ff71n'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracing the colonization and diversification of the worldwide seabird ectoparasite Ixodes uriae']

We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia.

"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l.

In this study, we explored the role that moose and winter ticks play in transmission of the tick-borne bacterial pathogen, <i>Anaplasma</i>, which causes mild to severe illness in humans and domestic animals. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the prevalence of <i>Anaplasma</i> spp. in moose and winter tick, (2) determine the phylogenetic placement of these strains with respect to those found in other hosts and vectors, and (3) explore risk factors of <i>Anaplasma</i> infection in moose. A total of 157 moose (142 calves, 15 adults) were captured in western (<i>n </i>= 83) and northern (<i>n </i>= 74) Maine in 2017 and 2018. We screened for <i>Anaplasma </i>spp. in moose whole blood samples using a genus-specific PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene. We found that over half (54%) of the moose were infected with <i>Anaplasma </i>bacteria, with a greater proportion of moose harboring <i>Anaplasma</i>-infections in the western (67%) versus northern study areas (38%). Male moose also exhibited a higher prevalence than females (63% vs. 47%). \xa0In contrast, <i>Anaplasma </i>prevalence in winter ticks was low (&lt;1%). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the single <i>Anaplasma </i>strain in moose was highly divergent from the strain in winter ticks, and most closely related to an uncharacterized North American cervid strain. We conclude that winter ticks are unlikely to play a significant role in <i>Anaplasma </i>transmission to moose, however high infection prevalence warrants further investigation into the impacts of the disease on moose health.</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'James', 'lastName': 'Elliott', 'email': 'jameselliott978@gmail.com', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49'}, {'firstName': 'Caroline', 'lastName': 'Dickson', 'email': 'caroline.c.dickson@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49', 'orcid': '0000-0003-4534-9284'}, {'firstName': 'Kantar', 'lastName': 'Lee', 'email': 'lee.kantar@maine.gov', 'affiliation': 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/050awhq57'}, {'firstName': 'Matthew', 'lastName': ""O'Neal"", 'email': 'matthew.r.oneal@maine.gov', 'affiliation': 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/050awhq57', 'orcid': '0000-0002-2785-6330'}, {'firstName': 'Anne', 'lastName': 'Lichtenwalner', 'email': 'anne.lichtenwalner@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49'}, {'firstName': 'Ann', 'lastName': 'Bryant', 'email': 'ann.bryant@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49'}, {'firstName': 'Walter', 'lastName': 'Jakubas', 'email': 'wjj637@icloud.com', 'affiliation': 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/050awhq57'}, {'firstName': 'Peter', 'lastName': 'Pekins', 'email': 'pete.pekins@unh.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of New Hampshire', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01rmh9n78'}, {'firstName': 'Sandra', 'lastName': 'De Urioste-Stone', 'email': 'sandra.de@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49'}, {'firstName': 'Pauline', 'lastName': 'Kamath', 'email': 'pauline.kamath@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Maine', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01adr0w49'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.tb2rbp00j'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data From: Prevalence and risk factors of Anaplasma infections in eastern moose (Alces alces americana) and winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) in Maine, United States']"

Many penguin species form large social colonies, and are highly philopatric, returning to the same nest or burrow, along the same route, after each trip to sea. Within a colony, however, the local abundance, physical similarity, and nocturnal habits of penguins hinder the observation of fine-scale movements. To determine the extent of movement and interaction of penguins within colonies, a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach was used to study the fine-scale structure of ticks—which depend on host movements for dispersal—exploiting the largest Little Penguin (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) colony in Australia (Phillip Island, Victoria). No barriers to tick gene flow were identified, and we infer that extensive penguin movement occurs throughout the colony.

"['Aim Organisms with poor intrinsic dispersal capacity, such as parasites, often rely entirely on transport with host species that have a greater dispersal capacity. Penguins, for example, are exploited by terrestrial ectoparasites when they come ashore to breed. Recent research indicates that little penguin (Eudyptula minor and E. novaehollandiae) hard ticks (Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi) may be capable of surviving short periods (days) at sea with their hosts, but their capacity to survive longer voyages (weeks) is not known. We here aimed to assess whether phylogeographic patterns in little penguins and their ticks indicate that the terrestrial ectoparasites are able to disperse long distances at sea with their swimming hosts. Location Southern Australia and New Zealand. Taxon Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi ticks.\r\nMethods We conducted a broad-scale genomic assessment of little penguin ticks from across their hosts’ ranges in Australia and New Zealand. Using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS), we generated SNP data sets from ticks from 14 penguin colonies, and analysed phylogeographic structure. We included ticks from some sympatric flighted seabirds to verify host-specificity. Results We resolved two distinct lineages of Ixodes from little penguins, with one restricted to Australia, and the other found throughout New Zealand and in low numbers at some eastern Australian sites. Both lineages exhibited phylogeographic structure consistent with patterns observed in their hosts, with some evidence of occasional oceanic dispersal, including across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Ticks from sympatric short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), which disperse aerially, were genetically distinct from those collected from little penguins, supporting prior evidence of host-specificity in seabird ticks. Main conclusions The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that ticks can travel at sea with little penguins.

We analysed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels.

"['The seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) parasitizes over 60 host species in the circumpolar regions of both hemispheres, and acts as a vector for a number of potentially virulent pathogens. On Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, the nestlings of Cassin’s Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) are often parasitized by seabird ticks, which may affect their growth and survival in the nest. We used a logistic growth model to interpolate between successive measures of mass (g) and wing chord (mm) for 558 Cassin’s Auklet and 344 Rhinoceros Auklet chicks over 11 years from 1996 to 2007. From the model, we estimated the asymptotic measure and the age at inflection point for each chick’s growth trajectory, and assessed the effect of tick load relative to other sources of annual and seasonal variation in growth. Most chicks (72.4% of Cassin’s Auklets, and 62.2% of Rhinoceros Auklets) hosted ≥1 ticks at least once while in the nest, and the median tick load was two in both species. The probability of hosting a tick declined strongly with chick age, such that by day 40 after hatching less than 1% hosted ticks. We found evidence that tick load had a negative effect on asymptotic weights and wing lengths of both species, but the effect was minor relative to that of other sources of annual and seasonal variation. Only at very high loads – which were rare – did ticks have effects on growth that were likely to be biologically relevant. Tick load had little effect on survival to fledging in either species.We argue that these mild effects of ticks on their hosts are consistent with a co-evolutionary process that results in intermediate virulence when parasite transmission is linked to host recovery.']","[[{'firstName': 'J.

We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States.

"['Individual hosts vary substantially in their parasite loads. However, whether individual hosts have consistently different loads remains uncertain. If so, hosts that have <i>consistently</i> high parasite loads may serve as key reservoirs or super-spreaders. Thus, identifying whether individuals persistently differ in their parasitism and the factors that explain these patterns constitute important issues for disease ecology and management. To investigate these topics, we examined nine years of tick counts in a wild population of sleepy lizards, <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>. Lizards were individually marked, and throughout their activity season, often across several years, we repeatedly assessed lizards’ ticks (to stage – larva, nymph, adult male, and adult female – and species, either <i>Bothriocroton hydrosauri</i> or <i>Amblyomma limbatum</i>). Using these repeated individual measures, we determined whether tick counts were repeatable. Then, we tested predictors of average tick counts, particularly lizard mass, sex, behavioural type (aggression and boldness), and the distance between lizards’ home range centre and a road transecting the study site (an area of greater food and lizard activity). We found that lizards exhibited consistent individual differences in tick loads both within and across years. Within-lizard yearly average counts of larvae and nymphs were positively correlated. Lizards closer to the road tended to have more larvae and nymphs of both species and more adult <i>B. hydrosauri</i>. Sex did not affect tick counts. Mass differentially affected adult female <i>A. limbatum</i> and adult male <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts. Intriguingly, lizards with above average aggression but below average boldness, or vice versa, tended to have higher average adult female <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts.

"['<p>1.) The species interactions that structure natural communities are increasingly disrupted by radical habitat change resulting from the widespread processes of urbanization and species translocations. Although many species are disadvantaged by these changes, others thrive in these new environments, achieving densities exceeding those found in natural habitats. Often the same species that benefit from urbanization are successful invaders in introduced habitats, suggesting that similar processes promote these species in both environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.) Both processes may especially benefit certain species by modifying their interactions with harmful parasites (“enemy release”). To detect such modifications, we first need to identify the mechanisms underlying host-parasite associations in natural populations, then test whether they are disrupted in cities and introduced habitats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.) We studied the interaction between the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>), a globally invasive species native to South America, and its <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks. Our field study of 642 cane toads across 46 sites within their native range in French Guiana revealed that 56% of toads carried ticks, and that toads with ticks were in poor body condition relative to uninfected conspecifics. Across natural and disturbed habitats, tick prevalence and abundance increased with toad density, but this association was disrupted in the urban environment, where tick abundance remained low even where toad densities were high, and prevalence decreased with density.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.) Reductions in the abundance of ticks in urban habitats may be attributable to pesticides (which are sprayed for mosquito control, but are also lethal to ticks), and our literature review shows that tick abundance is generally lower in cane toads from urban habitats across South America.

"['Urban species encounter resources that are uncommon in nature, such as materials found in city waste. Many studies have shown that these can be harmful to wildlife. In Mexico City, house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which reduces the amount of ectoparasites, but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet, the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively, disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches Carpodacus mexicanus increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present, fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away, we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest, as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched, and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks, 2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation.

Here, we characterized MHC class I polymorphism in a lizard whose habitat preferences (rock outcrops) lead to the formation of well-defined and stable populations. We investigated the association between the load of ticks, which were used as a proxy for the load of pathogens they transmit, and MHC class I polymorphism across populations in two types of habitat: undisturbed reserves and agricultural land. We hypothesized that the association would be positive across undisturbed reserve populations, but across fragmented agricultural land populations the relationship would be distorted by the loss of MHC variation due to drift. After controlling for habitat, MHC diversity was not associated with tick number, and the habitats did not differ in this respect. Neither did we detect a difference between habitats in the relationship between MHC and neutral diversity, which was positive across all populations. However, there was extensive variation in the number of MHC alleles per individual, and we found that tick number was positively associated with the average number of alleles carried by lizards across reserve populations, but not across populations from disturbed agricultural land. Our results thus indicate that local differences in selection from parasites may contribute to MHC copy number variation within species, but habitat degradation can distort this relationship.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jacek', 'lastName': 'Radwan', 'affiliation': 'Jagiellonian University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03bqmcz70'}, {'firstName': 'Katarzyna', 'lastName': 'Kuduk', 'affiliation': 'Jagiellonian University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03bqmcz70'}, {'firstName': 'Esther', 'lastName': 'Levy', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Natasha', 'lastName': 'LeBas', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Wieslaw', 'lastName': 'Babik', 'affiliation': 'Jagiellonian University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03bqmcz70'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.19264'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Parasite load and MHC diversity in undisturbed and agriculturally modified habitats of the ornate dragon lizard']
"['Models used to investigate the relationship between biodiversity change and vector-borne disease risk often do not explicitly include the vector; they instead rely on a frequency-dependent transmission function to represent vector dynamics. However, differences between classes of vector (e.g., ticks and insects) can cause discrepancies in epidemiological responses to environmental change. Using a pair of disease models (mosquito- and tick-borne), we simulated substitutive and additive biodiversity change (where noncompetent hosts replaced or were added to competent hosts, respectively), while considering different relationships between vector and host densities. We found important differences between classes of vector, including an increased likelihood of amplified disease risk under additive biodiversity change in mosquito models, driven by higher vector biting rates. We also draw attention to more general phenomena, such as a negative relationship between initial infection prevalence in vectors and likelihood of dilution, and the potential for a rise in density of infected vectors to occur simultaneously with a decline in proportion of infected hosts. This has important implications; the density of infected vectors is the most valid metric for primarily zoonotic infections, while the proportion of infected hosts is more relevant for infections where humans are a primary host.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew David MacEwan', 'lastName': 'Dobson'}, {'firstName': 'Stuart K.

"['<p>Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss, responsible for an alteration of intraspecific patterns of neutral genetic diversity and structure. Although neutral genetic variation can be informative for demographic inferences, it may be a poor predictor of adaptive genetic diversity and thus of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on selective evolutionary processes. In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper <i>Glyphorynchus spirurus</i>. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. selection) may be different depending on loci considered. Finally, tick prevalence was higher in fragmented environments. We discussed the hypothesis that pathogen selective pressures may contribute to maintain adaptive genetic diversity despite the negative demographic effect of habitat fragmentation on neutral genetic diversity.</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Antoine', 'lastName': 'Perrin', 'email': 'antoine.perrin@u-bourgogne.fr', 'affiliation': 'Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02dn7x778', 'orcid': '0000-0001-5100-8473'}, {'firstName': 'Aurélie', 'lastName': 'Khimoun', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02dn7x778'}, {'firstName': 'Bruno', 'lastName': 'Faivre', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02dn7x778'}, {'firstName': 'Anthony', 'lastName': 'Ollivier', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02dn7x778'}, {'firstName': 'Nyls', 'lastName': 'de Pracontal', 'email': '', 'affiliation': ""Groupe d'Etude et de Protection des Oiseaux en Guyane""}, {'firstName': 'Franck', 'lastName': 'Théron', 'email': '', 'affiliation': ""Groupe d'Etude et de Protection des Oiseaux en Guyane""}, {'firstName': 'Maxime', 'lastName': 'Loubon', 'email': '', 'affiliation': ""Groupe d'Etude et de Protection des Oiseaux en Guyane""}, {'firstName': 'Gilles', 'lastName': 'Leblond', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'SARL BIOS'}, {'firstName': 'Olivier', 'lastName': 'Duron', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Maladies Infectieuses et Vecteurs : Ecologie, Génétique, Evolution et Contrôle', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00357kh21'}, {'firstName': 'Stéphane', 'lastName': 'Garnier', 'email': '', 'affiliation': 'Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02dn7x778'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8gtht76kk'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Habitat fragmentation differentially shapes neutral and immune gene variation in a tropical bird species']
"['The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large gene family that plays a central role in the immune system of all jawed vertebrates. Non-avian reptiles are under-represented within the MHC literature and little is understood regarding the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in this vertebrate group. Here, we examined the relative roles of parasite-mediated selection and sexual selection in maintaining MHC class I diversity of a colour polymorphic lizard. We discovered evidence for parasite-mediated selection acting via rare-allele advantage or fluctuating selection as ectoparasite load was significantly lower in the presence of a specific MHC supertype (functional clustering of alleles); supertype four. Based on comparisons between ectoparasite prevalence and load, and assessment of the impact of ectoparasite load on host fitness, we suggest that supertype four confers quantitative resistance to ticks or an intracellular tick-borne parasite. We found no evidence for MHC-associated mating in terms of pair genetic distance, number of alleles or specific supertypes . An association was uncovered between supertype four and male throat colour morph. However, it is unlikely that male throat colouration acts as a signal of MHC genotype to conspecifics because we found no evidence to suggest that male throat colouration predicts male mating status. Overall, our results suggest that parasite-mediated selection plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in this population via rare allele advantage and/or fluctuating selection. Further work is required to determine whether sexual selection also plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in agamid lizards.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jessica D.', 'lastName': 'Hacking', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}, {'firstName': 'Devi', 'lastName': 'Stuart-Fox', 'affiliation': 'University of Melbourne', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01ej9dk98'}, {'firstName': 'Stephanie S.', 'lastName': 'Godfrey', 'affiliation': 'University of Otago', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01jmxt844'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Gardner', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mr31757'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Specific MHC class I supertype associated with parasite infection and colour morph in a wild lizard population']
"['Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural, non-human populations. Here we use a natural rodent-Borrelia system to test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e. the product of Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment shapes the evolution of the host’s immune system in the wild.']","[[{'firstName': 'Luca', 'lastName': 'Cornetti', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Daniela', 'lastName': 'Hilfiker', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Mélissa', 'lastName': 'Lemoine', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.7sr405h'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Small-scale spatial variation in infection risk shapes the evolution of a Borrelia resistance gene in wild rodents']

Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair.

We found seven different strains, as defined by ospC genotype.

Yet for many wild organisms, age is an inaccessible trait. In many cases measuring age or ageing rates in the wild requires molecular biomarkers of age. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation have been shown to accurately estimate the age of humans and laboratory mice, but they also show variable ticking rates that are associated with mortality risk above and beyond that predicted by chronological age. Thus, epigenetic clocks are proving to be useful markers of both chronological and biological age, and they are beginning to be applied to wild mammals and birds.

While this relationship is congruent with the location and architecture of the coxal glands, a long-forgotten character system that opens in the pedipalpal segments only in palpigrades and solifuges, we show that nodal support values in concatenated supermatrices can mask high levels of underlying topological conflict in the placement of the enigmatic Palpigradi.\xa0</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Ballesteros', 'email': 'ballesterosc@wisc.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}, {'firstName': 'Carlos', 'lastName': 'Santibáñez López', 'email': 'caecentrus@gmail.com', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41', 'orcid': '0000-0001-6062-282X'}, {'firstName': 'Ľubomír', 'lastName': 'Kováč', 'email': 'lubomir.kovac@upjs.sk', 'affiliation': 'University of Pavol Jozef Šafárik', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/039965637', 'orcid': '0000-0001-8194-2128'}, {'firstName': 'Efrat', 'lastName': 'Gavish-Regev', 'email': 'efrat.gavish-regev@mail.huji.ac.il', 'affiliation': 'Hebrew University of Jerusalem', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qxff017'}, {'firstName': 'Prashant', 'lastName': 'Sharma', 'email': 'prashant.sharma@wisc.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41', 'orcid': '0000-0002-2328-9084'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t1g1jwsz4'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Ordered phylogenomic subsampling enables diagnosis of systematic errors in the placement of the enigmatic arachnid order Palpigradi ']
"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans. We found two significant associations between DQB haplotypes and infection status: one haplotype was associated with lower risk of infection (resistance), while another was associated with higher risk of infection (susceptibility). Interestingly, allelic divergence within individuals was higher for voles with the resistance haplotype compared to other voles. In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles. The pattern of higher allelic divergence in individuals with the resistance haplotype is consistent with NFDS favouring divergent alleles in a natural population, hence selection where DAA works in concert with NFDS.\xa0</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Kristin', 'lastName': 'Scherman', 'email': 'kristin.scherman@icloud.com', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Råberg', 'email': 'lars.raberg@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Helena', 'lastName': 'Westerdahl', 'email': 'helena.westerdahl@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.x69p8czjj'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Borrelia infection in bank voles Myodes glareolus is associated with specific DQB haplotypes which affect allelic divergence within individuals']
"['Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) are traditionally regarded as sister to the clade of terrestrial chelicerates (Arachnida). This hypothesis has been challenged by recent phylogenomic analyses,  but the non-monophyly of Arachnida has consistently been disregarded  as artifactual. We reevaluated the placement of Xiphosura among chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic dataset to date, expanding outgroup sampling and including data from whole genome sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in theplacement of some arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is apparent that the radiation of Arachnids is an old one and occurred over a brief  period of time, resulting in several consecutive short internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of incomplete lineage sorting  (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees  to explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were evaluated, as well as the effects of fast  evolving partitions and the dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that the placement of horseshoe crabs can not be explained by missing data, compositional biases, saturation, or incomplete  lineage sorting. Interrogation of the phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic arachnids comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long standing paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat. Future studies testing chelicerate relationships should approach the task with a sampling strategy where the monophyly of Arachnida is not held as the premise.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jesus A.', 'lastName': 'Ballesteros', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}, {'firstName': 'Prashant P.', 'lastName': 'Sharma', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2g1f4n5'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: A critical appraisal of the placement of Xiphosura (Chelicerata) with account of known sources of phylogenetic error']
"['Pathogen evasion of the host immune system is a key force driving extreme polymorphism in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although this gene family is well characterized in structure and function, there is still much debate surrounding the mechanisms by which MHC diversity is selectively maintained. Many studies have investigated relationships between MHC variation and specific pathogens, and have found mixed support for and against the hypotheses of heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection. Few, however, have focused on the selective effects of multiple parasite types on host immunogenetic patterns. Here, we examined relationships between variation in the equine MHC gene, ELA-DRA, and both gastrointestinal (GI) and ectoparasitism in plains zebras (Equus quagga). Specific alleles present at opposing population frequencies had antagonistic effects, with rare alleles associated with increased GI parasitism and common alleles with increased tick burdens. These results support a frequency-dependent mechanism, but are also consistent with fluctuating selection. Maladaptive GI parasite ‘susceptibility alleles’ were reduced in frequency, suggesting that these parasites may play a greater selective role at this locus. Heterozygote advantage, in terms of allele mutational divergence, also predicted decreased GI parasite burden in genotypes with a common allele. We conclude that an immunogenetic trade-off affects resistance/susceptibility to parasites in this system. Because GI and ectoparasites do not directly interact within hosts, our results uniquely show that antagonistic parasite interactions can be indirectly modulated through the host immune system. This study highlights the importance of investigating the role of multiple parasites in shaping patterns of host immunogenetic variation.']","[[{'firstName': 'Pauline L.', 'lastName': 'Kamath', 'email': 'pauline.kamath@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}, {'firstName': 'Wendy C.', 'lastName': 'Turner', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Martina', 'lastName': 'Küsters', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley Etosha Anthrax Research Project, Swakopmund, Namibia'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne M.', 'lastName': 'Getz', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p083b'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Parasite-mediated selection drives an immunogenetic tradeoff in plains zebras (Equus quagga)']

It has been detected, in our lab, that Ixodes pacificus is host to Rickettsia species phylotype G021. This endosymbiont is predominantly present, and 100% maternally transmitted in I. pacificus. To study roles of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, bioinformatic and molecular approaches were carried out. MUMmer genome alignments of whole genome sequence of I. scapularis, a close relative to I. pacificus, against completely sequenced genomes of R. bellii OSU85-389, R. conorii, and R. felis, identified 8,190 unique sequences that are homologous to Rickettsia sequences in the NCBI Trace Archive. MetaCyc metabolic reconstructions revealed that all folate gene orthologues (folA, folC, folE, folKP, ptpS) required for de novo folate biosynthesis are present in the genome of Rickettsia buchneri in I. scapularis. To examine the metabolic capability of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, genes of the folate biosynthesis pathway of the bacterium were PCR amplified using degenerate primers. BLAST searches identified that nucleotide sequences of the folA, folC, folE, folKP, and ptpS genes possess 98.6%, 98.8%, 98.9%, 98.5% and 99.0% identity respectively to the corresponding genes of Rickettsia buchneri. Phylogenetic tree constructions show that the folate genes of phylotype G021 and homologous genes from various Rickettsia species are monophyletic.

"['The mechanisms underlying honest signal expression remain elusive and may involve the integration of social and physiological costs. Corticosterone is a socially modulated metabolic hormone that mediates energy investment and behavior and may therefore function to deter dishonest signal expression. We examined the relationship between corticosterone and green badge coloration in male sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), hypothesizing that physiological and behavioral costs resulting from elevated baseline glucocorticoids function in maintenance of honest signal expression. We found that large-badged males had higher corticosterone titer, with this relationship apparent at the end of the season and absent early in the season. Large-badged males also suffered higher ectoparasite load (number of tick nymphs), despite being in better condition than small-badged males. Ectoparasite load was positively related to corticosterone titer early in the season at the time of badge formation. High-condition individuals had lower corticosterone and lower numbers of ectoparasites than low-condition individuals, suggestive of conditional variation in ability to withstand costs of corticosterone. We found an opposing negative relationship between corticosterone titer and endoparasite load. Corticosterone titer was also negatively associated with male mobility, a fitness-determining behavior in this species. Because badge size is involved in mediating agonistic social interactions in this species, our results suggest that badge-dependent variation in corticosterone is likely reflective of variation in social conditions experienced over the course of the season. Our results implicate corticosterone in maintenance of signal honesty, both early in the season through enforcement of physiological costs (ectoparasite load) and during the season through behavioral costs (male mobility). We propose that socially modulated variation in corticosterone critically functions in mediation of signal honesty without requiring a direct role for corticosterone in trait expression.']","[[{'firstName': 'Willow R.', 'lastName': 'Lindsay', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Wapstra', 'affiliation': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01nfmeh72'}, {'firstName': 'Bengt', 'lastName': 'Silverin', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Mats', 'lastName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': 'University of Sydney', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/0384j8v12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.67136'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Corticosterone: a costly mediator of signal honesty in sand lizards']
"['The Near East cattle are adapted to different agro-ecological zones including desert areas, mountains habitats as well as humid regions along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers system.

Among these, the Jenoubi is found in the southern more humid part of Iraq while the Rustaqi is found in the middle and drier region of the country. Despite their importance, Iraqi cattle have up to now been poorly characterized at genome level. Here, we report at genome-wide level the diversity and signature of positive selection in these two breeds. Thirty-five unrelated Jenoubi cattle, sampled in the Maysan and Basra regions, and 60 Rustaqi cattle, from around Baghdad and Babylon, were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip (700K). Genetic population structure and diversity level were studied using principal component analysis (PCA), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and admixture. Signatures of selection were studied using Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) (iHS and Rsb) and inter-population Wright’s Fst. The results of PCA and admixture analysis, including European taurine, Asian indicine, African indicine and taurine indicate that the two breeds are crossbreed zebu x taurine, with more zebu background in Jenoubi cattle compared to Rustaqi. The Rustaqi has the greatest mean heterozygosity (He = 0.37) among all breeds. iHS and Rsb signature of selection analyses identify 68 candidate genes under positive selection in the two Iraqi breeds, while Fst analysis identifies 220 candidate genes including genes related to the innate and acquired immunity responses, different environmental selection pressures (e.g. tick resistance, heat stress) and genes of commercial interest (e.g. marbling score).']","[[{'firstName': 'Akil Farouk', 'lastName': 'Alshawi'}, {'firstName': 'Abdulameer', 'lastName': 'Essa'}, {'firstName': 'Sahar', 'lastName': 'Al-Bayatti'}, {'firstName': 'Olivier', 'lastName': 'Hanotte'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t35r32q'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Genome analysis reveals genetic admixture and signature of selection for productivity and environmental traits in Iraqi cattle']

"['<p><span style=""background:white;"">Habitat quality regulates fitness and population density, making it a key driver of population size. Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses “best available science”, extending inferences across taxa, space or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>),<i> </i>which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex tradeoff between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.</span></p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Amanda', 'lastName': 'Cheeseman', 'email': 'acheesem@esf.edu', 'affiliation': 'SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00qv0tw17', 'orcid': '0000-0002-3744-0945'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9khq'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Survival and density of New England cottontail and Eastern cottontail']
"['The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.']","[[{'firstName': 'Allison L.', 'lastName': 'Hicks', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}, {'firstName': 'Siobain', 'lastName': 'Duffy', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.58ss8'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Cell tropism predicts long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction.

"['Background: Despite considerable effort, progress in spider molecular systematics has lagged behind many other comparable arthropod groups, thereby hindering family-level resolution, classification, and testing of important macroevolutionary hypotheses. Recently, alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches, Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE), is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome, for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders, with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Results: Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci, we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome, three published araneomorph spider genomes, and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit, we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa, 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa, 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus Aphonopelma (83 taxa, 581 loci). At the deepest level, all three major spider lineages (the Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae) were supported with high bootstrap support. Strong support was also found throughout the Euctenizidae, including generic relationships within the family and species relationships within the genus Aptostichus. As in the Euctenizidae, virtually identical topologies were inferred with high support throughout Aphonopelma. Conclusions: The Spider Probe Kit, the first implementation of AHE methodology in Class Arachnida, holds great promise for gathering the types and quantities of molecular data needed to accelerate an understanding of the spider Tree of Life by providing a mechanism whereby different researchers can confidently and effectively use the same loci for independent projects, yet allowing synthesis of data across independent research groups.']","[[{'firstName': 'Chris A.', 'lastName': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}, {'firstName': 'Alan R.', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Emily Moriarty', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Jason E.', 'lastName': 'Bond', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.5027d'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Expanding anchored hybrid enrichment to resolve both deep and shallow relationships within the spider tree of life']
"['Both large-wildlife loss and climatic changes can independently influence the prevalence and distribution of zoonotic disease. Given growing evidence that wildlife loss often has stronger community-level effects in low-productivity areas, we hypothesized that these perturbations would have interactive effects on disease risk. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by measuring tick abundance and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (Coxiella burnetii and Rickettsia spp.) within long-term, size-selective, large-herbivore exclosures replicated across a precipitation gradient in East Africa. Total wildlife exclusion increased total tick abundance by 130% (mesic sites) to 225% (dry, low-productivity sites), demonstrating a significant interaction of defaunation and aridity on tick abundance. When differing degrees of exclusion were tested for a subset of months, total tick abundance increased from 170% (only mega-herbivores excluded) to 360% (all large wildlife excluded). Wildlife exclusion differentially affected the abundance of the three dominant tick species, and this effect varied strongly over time, likely due to differences among species in their host associations, seasonality, and other ecological characteristics. Pathogen prevalence did not differ across wildlife exclusion treatments, rainfall levels, or tick species, suggesting that exposure risk will respond to defaunation and climate change in proportion to total tick abundance. These findings demonstrate interacting effects of defaunation and aridity that increase disease risk, and they highlight the need to incorporate ecological context when predicting effects of wildlife loss on zoonotic disease dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Georgia', 'lastName': 'Titcomb', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Brian F.', 'lastName': 'Allan', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Ainsworth', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Henson', 'lastName': 'Lauren', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Tyler', 'lastName': 'Hedlund', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Robert M.', 'lastName': 'Pringle', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Todd M.', 'lastName': 'Palmer', 'affiliation': 'University of Florida', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y3ad647'}, {'firstName': 'Laban', 'lastName': 'Njoroge', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Campana', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'Robert C.', 'lastName': 'Fleischer', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}, {'firstName': 'John Naisikie', 'lastName': 'Mantas', 'affiliation': 'Mpala Research Center and Wildlife Foundation', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04c466w42'}, {'firstName': 'Hillary S.', 'lastName': 'Young', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Lauren', 'lastName': 'Henson', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04hnzva96'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.sf33k'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Interacting effects of wildlife loss and climate on ticks and tick-borne disease']
"['<p>The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics), or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of Neotropical ticks, collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites, but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. <i>Francisella </i>and <i>Rickettsia </i>were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species and we found both positive and negative co-occurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g. <i>Coxiella</i>, <i>Rickettsiella</i>) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected <i>Anaplasma</i> and <i>Bartonella </i>in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of Neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species, life stage) and collection site.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.']","[[{'firstName': 'Richard S.', 'lastName': 'Ostfeld', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Taal', 'lastName': 'Levi', 'affiliation': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00ysfqy60'}, {'firstName': 'Felicia', 'lastName': 'Keesing', 'affiliation': 'Bard College', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04yrgt058'}, {'firstName': 'Kelly', 'lastName': 'Oggenfuss', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Charles D.', 'lastName': 'Canham', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d1c8046'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tick-borne disease risk in a forest food web']
"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole.

In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens. We found that larval burden on two rodent species decreased with activity of two predator species, while DON and DIN for all three pathogens increased with larval burden on rodents, as predicted.

We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures or both. We infested males with larval ticks and staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals.

"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']

Here, I show that the infectivity (probability of transmission) of the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii from two of its natural rodent hosts (bank vole and yellow-necked mouse) to its main tick vector increases asymptotically with increasing exploitation (measured as bacterial load in skin biopsies). Hence, this result provides support for one of the basic assumptions of the ‘trade-off hypothesis’. Moreover, there was no difference in infectivity between bank voles and yellow-necked mice despite bacterial loads being on average an order of magnitude higher in bank voles, most likely because ticks took larger blood meals from mice.

"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales.

"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']
"['<p>Ecological factors and individual-specific traits affect parasite infestation in wild animals. We studied various key ecological variables (breeding density, human disturbance) and phenotypic traits (exploratory behaviour, body condition) proposed to predict tick infestation probability and burden in great tits (<i>Parus major</i>). Our study spanned three years and 12 nest-box plots located in southern Germany. Adult breeders were assessed for exploration behaviour, body condition, and tick burden. Plots were open to human recreation; human disturbance was quantified in each plot as a recreation pressure index from biweekly nest box inspections. Infested individuals were repeatable in tick burden across years. These repeatable among-individual differences in tick burden were not attributable to exploration behaviour. However, faster explorers did have a higher infestation probability. Furthermore, body condition negatively correlated to tick burden. Recreation pressure also tended to increase infestation probability. Our study implies that avian infestation probability and tick burden are each governed by distinct phenotypic traits and ecological factors.

"['Nonhuman primate species spend a conspicuous amount of time grooming during social interactions, a behaviour that probably serves both social and health-related functions. While the social implications of grooming have been relatively well studied, less attention has been paid to the health benefits, especially the removal of ectoparasites, which may act as vectors in disease transmission. In this study, we examined whether grooming behaviour reduced tick load (number of ticks) and haemoprotozoan infection status in a population of wild adult baboons (Papio cynocephalus). We found that younger and higher-ranking adults were groomed more often than older, low-ranking adults, and females were groomed more often than males. Animals that received more grooming, in turn, had lower tick loads. Baboons with lower tick loads had higher packed red cell volume (PCV or haematocrit), one general measure of health status. We detected a tick-borne haemoprotozoan, Babesia microti, but its low prevalence in the population precluded identifying sources of variance in infection.']","[[{'firstName': 'Mercy Y.', 'lastName': 'Akinyi', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Susan C.', 'lastName': 'Alberts', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Jeanne', 'lastName': 'Altmann', 'affiliation': 'Princeton University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00hx57361'}, {'firstName': 'Nilesh B.', 'lastName': 'Patel', 'affiliation': 'University of Nairobi', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02y9nww90'}, {'firstName': 'Jenny', 'lastName': 'Tung', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00py81415'}, {'firstName': 'Maamun', 'lastName': 'Jeneby', 'affiliation': 'National Museums of Kenya', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04sjpp691'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3r8n2'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Role of grooming in reducing tick load in wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus)']

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

We determined prevalence and infection intensity of ospC strains in naturally infected wild mammals (rodents and shrews) by 454 amplicon sequencing in combination with qPCR. Neither prevalence nor infection intensity of specific ospC strains varied in a species-specific manner (i.e. there were no significant ospC × host species interactions). Rankings of ospC prevalences were strongly positively correlated across host species. Rankings of ospC infection intensities were correlated more weakly, but only in one case significantly less than 1. ospC prevalences in the studied mammals were similar to those in ticks sampled at the study site, indicating that we did not miss any mammal species that are important hosts for specific ospC strains.

"['Background: The prolonged feeding process of ixodid ticks, in combination with bacterial transmission, should lead to a robust inflammatory response at the blood-feeding site. Yet, factors present in tick saliva may down-regulate such responses, which may be beneficial to spirochete transmission. The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that tick saliva, in the context of Borrelia burgdorferi, can have widespread effects on the production of immune mediators in skin.  Methods: A cross-section of tick feeding on skin was examined histologically. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"[""1. Assessing the impacts of multiple, often synergistic, stressors on the population dynamics of long-lived species is becoming increasingly important due to recent and future global change. 2. Tiliqua rugosa (sleepy lizard) is a long-lived skink (>30 years) that is adapted to survive in semi-arid environments with varying levels of parasite exposure and highly seasonal food availability. We used an exhaustive database of 30-years of capture-mark-recapture records to quantify the impacts of both parasite exposure and environmental conditions on the lizard's survival rates and long-term population dynamics. 3. Lizard abundance was relatively stable throughout the study period; however there were changing patterns in adult and juvenile apparent survival rates, driven by spatial and temporal variation in levels of tick exposure and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Extreme weather events during the winter and spring seasons were identified as important environmental drivers of survival. 4. Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme hot and dry winter and spring seasons in our South Australian study region; from a contemporary probability of 0.17 up to 0.47 - 0.83 in 2080 depending on the emissions scenario. Our stochastic population model projections showed that these future climatic conditions will induce a decline in the abundance of this long-lived reptile of up to 67% within 30 years from 2080, under worst case scenario modelling. 5. The results have broad implications for future work investigating the drivers of population dynamics and persistence.

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"
"['The endophilic tick Ixodes arboricola infests cavity-nesting birds, and its dispersal strongly depends on the movements of its host. Population genetic structure of I. arboricola was studied with seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. We collected 268 ticks from 76 nest boxes in four woodlots near Antwerp, Belgium. These nest boxes are mainly used by the principal hosts of I. arboricola, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus. As these birds typically return to the same cavity for roosting or breeding, ticks within nest boxes were expected to be highly related, and tick populations were expected to be spatially structured among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. In line with the expectations, genetic population structure was found among woodlots and among nest boxes within woodlots. Surprisingly, there was considerable genetic variation among ticks within nest boxes. This could be explained by continuous gene flow from ticks from nearby tree holes, yet this remains to be tested. A pairwise relatedness analysis conducted for all pairs of ticks within nest boxes showed that relatedness among larvae was much higher than among later instars, which suggests that larvae are the most important instar for tick dispersal. Overall, tick populations at the studied spatial scale are not as differentiated as predicted, which may influence the scale at which host–parasite evolution occurs.']","[[{'firstName': 'Kurt', 'lastName': 'Jordaens', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Backeljau', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'A.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag. We highlight the important role of the genospecies’ pathogenicity and the host associations for understanding the epidemiology of disseminated Lyme borreliosis.']","[[{'firstName': 'Atle', 'lastName': 'Mysterud', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Dieter', 'lastName': 'Heylen', 'affiliation': 'University of Hasselt', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04nbhqj75'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Mathyssen', 'affiliation': 'University of Antwerp', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008x57b05'}, {'firstName': 'Aïda', 'lastName': 'Garcia', 'affiliation': 'Lista Bird Observatory, 4563 Borhaug, Norway'}, {'firstName': 'Solveig', 'lastName': 'Jore', 'affiliation': 'Norwegian Institute of Public Health', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/046nvst19'}, {'firstName': 'Hildegunn', 'lastName': 'Viljugrein', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.c7q3n2c'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Lyme neuroborreliosis and bird populations in northern Europe']
"['Modelling the spatial spread of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens maintained in enzootic transmission cycles remains a major challenge. The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach—occupancy modelling—to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases.

"['Historical patterns of dispersal and population isolation are key components shaping contemporary genetic diversity across landscapes and require explicit consideration when examining the relative role of different factors in driving the evolution of host specificity in parasitic organisms. In this study, we investigate the worldwide colonisation history of a common ectoparasite of seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae. This tick has a circumpolar distribution across both hemispheres, but has repeatedly formed host-specific races within different regions. By combining mitochondrial and nuclear data, we infer how this species spread to its present-day distribution and how the colonisation process has affected the geographic and host-associated structure of this tick within regions. We demonstrate that I. uriae is highly structured and isolates into four genetic groups that correspond to well-defined geographical regions. Molecular dating suggests that the diversification of I. uriae began in the early Miocene (22 Myr) and that this tick colonised most of the Southern hemisphere before moving into northern latitudes via two independent routes. However, no relationship between the degree of host race divergence and colonisation history was evident, supporting previous hypotheses that host specialization evolves relatively rapidly in this parasite, but does not typically lead to speciation. We discuss the possible historical and contemporary mechanisms of large scale dispersal for this ectoparasite and how its biological characteristics may condition current patterns of genetic diversity. More generally, our results illustrate how combining broad-scale sampling and modern molecular tools can help disentangle complex patterns of diversification in widespread parasites.']","[[{'firstName': 'Muriel', 'lastName': 'Dietrich', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Florent', 'lastName': 'Kempf', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}, {'firstName': 'Thierry', 'lastName': 'Boulinier', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive"", 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/008rywf59'}, {'firstName': 'Karen D.', 'lastName': 'McCoy', 'affiliation': 'French National Centre for Scientific Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02feahw73'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.ff71n'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracing the colonization and diversification of the worldwide seabird ectoparasite Ixodes uriae']

We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia.

"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l.

Within a colony, however, the local abundance, physical similarity, and nocturnal habits of penguins hinder the observation of fine-scale movements. To determine the extent of movement and interaction of penguins within colonies, a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach was used to study the fine-scale structure of ticks—which depend on host movements for dispersal—exploiting the largest Little Penguin (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) colony in Australia (Phillip Island, Victoria). No barriers to tick gene flow were identified, and we infer that extensive penguin movement occurs throughout the colony. Our findings support the hypothesis that some penguin species are highly gregarious, socializing widely within colonies despite strong nest-site philopatry.']","[[{'firstName': 'Katherine L.', 'lastName': 'Moon', 'affiliation': 'Monash University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02bfwt286'}, {'firstName': 'Ceridwen I.', 'lastName': 'Fraser', 'affiliation': 'Australian National University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592'}, {'firstName': 'Steven L.', 'lastName': 'Chown', 'affiliation': 'Monash University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02bfwt286'}, {'firstName': 'Angela', 'lastName': 'McGaughran', 'affiliation': 'Australian National University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/019wvm592'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t12dr12'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Penguin ectoparasite panmixia suggests extensive host movement within a colony']

"['Aim Organisms with poor intrinsic dispersal capacity, such as parasites, often rely entirely on transport with host species that have a greater dispersal capacity. Penguins, for example, are exploited by terrestrial ectoparasites when they come ashore to breed. Recent research indicates that little penguin (Eudyptula minor and E. novaehollandiae) hard ticks (Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi) may be capable of surviving short periods (days) at sea with their hosts, but their capacity to survive longer voyages (weeks) is not known. We here aimed to assess whether phylogeographic patterns in little penguins and their ticks indicate that the terrestrial ectoparasites are able to disperse long distances at sea with their swimming hosts. Location Southern Australia and New Zealand. Taxon Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi ticks.\r\nMethods We conducted a broad-scale genomic assessment of little penguin ticks from across their hosts’ ranges in Australia and New Zealand. Using Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS), we generated SNP data sets from ticks from 14 penguin colonies, and analysed phylogeographic structure. We included ticks from some sympatric flighted seabirds to verify host-specificity. Results We resolved two distinct lineages of Ixodes from little penguins, with one restricted to Australia, and the other found throughout New Zealand and in low numbers at some eastern Australian sites. Both lineages exhibited phylogeographic structure consistent with patterns observed in their hosts, with some evidence of occasional oceanic dispersal, including across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Ticks from sympatric short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), which disperse aerially, were genetically distinct from those collected from little penguins, supporting prior evidence of host-specificity in seabird ticks. Main conclusions The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that ticks can travel at sea with little penguins. We infer that some terrestrial ectoparasites associated with aquatically-dispersing hosts have evolved the capacity to survive oceanic voyages.']","[[{'firstName': 'Katherine', 'lastName': 'Moon'}, {'firstName': 'Steven', 'lastName': 'Chown'}, {'firstName': 'Ceridwen', 'lastName': 'Fraser'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.1074560'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tandem host-parasite dispersal inferred from similarities in phylogeographic patterns among little penguins and their ‘terrestrial’ ectoparasites']

"['The seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) parasitizes over 60 host species in the circumpolar regions of both hemispheres, and acts as a vector for a number of potentially virulent pathogens. On Triangle Island, British Columbia, Canada, the nestlings of Cassin’s Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) are often parasitized by seabird ticks, which may affect their growth and survival in the nest. We used a logistic growth model to interpolate between successive measures of mass (g) and wing chord (mm) for 558 Cassin’s Auklet and 344 Rhinoceros Auklet chicks over 11 years from 1996 to 2007. From the model, we estimated the asymptotic measure and the age at inflection point for each chick’s growth trajectory, and assessed the effect of tick load relative to other sources of annual and seasonal variation in growth. Most chicks (72.4% of Cassin’s Auklets, and 62.2% of Rhinoceros Auklets) hosted ≥1 ticks at least once while in the nest, and the median tick load was two in both species. The probability of hosting a tick declined strongly with chick age, such that by day 40 after hatching less than 1% hosted ticks. We found evidence that tick load had a negative effect on asymptotic weights and wing lengths of both species, but the effect was minor relative to that of other sources of annual and seasonal variation. Only at very high loads – which were rare – did ticks have effects on growth that were likely to be biologically relevant. Tick load had little effect on survival to fledging in either species.We argue that these mild effects of ticks on their hosts are consistent with a co-evolutionary process that results in intermediate virulence when parasite transmission is linked to host recovery.']","[[{'firstName': 'J.

We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States.

If so, hosts that have <i>consistently</i> high parasite loads may serve as key reservoirs or super-spreaders. Thus, identifying whether individuals persistently differ in their parasitism and the factors that explain these patterns constitute important issues for disease ecology and management. To investigate these topics, we examined nine years of tick counts in a wild population of sleepy lizards, <i>Tiliqua rugosa</i>. Lizards were individually marked, and throughout their activity season, often across several years, we repeatedly assessed lizards’ ticks (to stage – larva, nymph, adult male, and adult female – and species, either <i>Bothriocroton hydrosauri</i> or <i>Amblyomma limbatum</i>). Using these repeated individual measures, we determined whether tick counts were repeatable. Then, we tested predictors of average tick counts, particularly lizard mass, sex, behavioural type (aggression and boldness), and the distance between lizards’ home range centre and a road transecting the study site (an area of greater food and lizard activity). We found that lizards exhibited consistent individual differences in tick loads both within and across years. Within-lizard yearly average counts of larvae and nymphs were positively correlated. Lizards closer to the road tended to have more larvae and nymphs of both species and more adult <i>B. hydrosauri</i>. Sex did not affect tick counts. Mass differentially affected adult female <i>A. limbatum</i> and adult male <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts. Intriguingly, lizards with above average aggression but below average boldness, or vice versa, tended to have higher average adult female <i>B. hydrosauri</i> tick counts.

We studied the interaction between the cane toad (<em>Rhinella marina</em>), a globally invasive species native to South America, and its <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks. Our field study of 642 cane toads across 46 sites within their native range in French Guiana revealed that 56% of toads carried ticks, and that toads with ticks were in poor body condition relative to uninfected conspecifics.

Reductions in the abundance of ticks in urban habitats may be attributable to pesticides (which are sprayed for mosquito control, but are also lethal to ticks), and our literature review shows that tick abundance is generally lower in cane toads from urban habitats across South America.

"['Urban species encounter resources that are uncommon in nature, such as materials found in city waste. Many studies have shown that these can be harmful to wildlife. In Mexico City, house finches bring cigarette butts to their nests, which reduces the amount of ectoparasites, but also induces genotoxic damage in chicks and parents. Yet, the reason for this behaviour is unknown. One possibility is that birds extract the cellulose fibres from discarded butts simply because they resemble feathers. Alternatively, disassembled cigarette butts may be brought to the nests because they repel ectoparasites. Here we tested the latter hypothesis by assessing whether house finches Carpodacus mexicanus increase the amount of cigarette butts in their nests in response to a raise in ectoparasite load. When present, fibres from butts are concentrated in the nest lining. By taking it away, we simultaneously removed most of the butt material and collected the bulk of the tick population infesting each nest, as these parasites cluster in the lining. We removed the bedding of nests when chicks had recently hatched, and randomly assigned each nests to one of the following treatments: 1) addition of live ticks, 2) addition of dead ticks and 3) simulation of tick addition. Females in the live ticks’ treatment added more butt fibres to their nests than parents in control treatments. Additionally, the amount of butt fibres in the original lining also predicted the amount of fibres added after the manipulation.

After controlling for habitat, MHC diversity was not associated with tick number, and the habitats did not differ in this respect. Neither did we detect a difference between habitats in the relationship between MHC and neutral diversity, which was positive across all populations.

We found important differences between classes of vector, including an increased likelihood of amplified disease risk under additive biodiversity change in mosquito models, driven by higher vector biting rates. We also draw attention to more general phenomena, such as a negative relationship between initial infection prevalence in vectors and likelihood of dilution, and the potential for a rise in density of infected vectors to occur simultaneously with a decline in proportion of infected hosts.

In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper <i>Glyphorynchus spirurus</i>. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant.

"['The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large gene family that plays a central role in the immune system of all jawed vertebrates. Non-avian reptiles are under-represented within the MHC literature and little is understood regarding the mechanisms maintaining MHC diversity in this vertebrate group. Here, we examined the relative roles of parasite-mediated selection and sexual selection in maintaining MHC class I diversity of a colour polymorphic lizard. We discovered evidence for parasite-mediated selection acting via rare-allele advantage or fluctuating selection as ectoparasite load was significantly lower in the presence of a specific MHC supertype (functional clustering of alleles); supertype four. Based on comparisons between ectoparasite prevalence and load, and assessment of the impact of ectoparasite load on host fitness, we suggest that supertype four confers quantitative resistance to ticks or an intracellular tick-borne parasite. We found no evidence for MHC-associated mating in terms of pair genetic distance, number of alleles or specific supertypes . An association was uncovered between supertype four and male throat colour morph. However, it is unlikely that male throat colouration acts as a signal of MHC genotype to conspecifics because we found no evidence to suggest that male throat colouration predicts male mating status. Overall, our results suggest that parasite-mediated selection plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in this population via rare allele advantage and/or fluctuating selection. Further work is required to determine whether sexual selection also plays a role in maintaining MHC diversity in agamid lizards.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jessica D.', 'lastName': 'Hacking', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}, {'firstName': 'Devi', 'lastName': 'Stuart-Fox', 'affiliation': 'University of Melbourne', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01ej9dk98'}, {'firstName': 'Stephanie S.', 'lastName': 'Godfrey', 'affiliation': 'University of Otago', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01jmxt844'}, {'firstName': 'Michael G.', 'lastName': 'Gardner', 'affiliation': 'Flinders University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01kpzv902'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mr31757'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Specific MHC class I supertype associated with parasite infection and colour morph in a wild lizard population']
"['Spatial variation in pathogen-mediated selection is predicted to influence the evolutionary trajectory of host populations and lead to spatial variation in their immunogenetic composition. However, to date few studies have been able to directly link small-scale spatial variation in infection risk to host immune gene evolution in natural, non-human populations. Here we use a natural rodent-Borrelia system to test for associations between landscape-level spatial variation in Borrelia infection risk along replicated elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) evolution, a candidate gene for Borrelia resistance, across bank vole (Myodes glareolus) populations. We found that Borrelia infection risk (i.e. the product of Borrelia prevalence in questing ticks and the average tick load of voles at a sampling site) was spatially variable and significantly negatively associated with elevation. Across sampling sites, Borrelia prevalence in bank voles was significantly positively associated with Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. We observed a significant association between naturally occurring TLR2 polymorphisms in hosts and their Borrelia infection status. The TLR2 variant associated with a reduced likelihood of Borrelia infection was most common in rodent populations at lower elevations that face a high Borrelia infection risk, and its frequency changed in accordance with the change in Borrelia infection risk along the elevational clines. These results suggest that small-scale spatial variation in parasite-mediated selection affects the immunogenetic composition of natural host populations, providing a striking example that the microbial environment shapes the evolution of the host’s immune system in the wild.']","[[{'firstName': 'Luca', 'lastName': 'Cornetti', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Daniela', 'lastName': 'Hilfiker', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Mélissa', 'lastName': 'Lemoine', 'affiliation': 'University of Zurich', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02crff812'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.7sr405h'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Small-scale spatial variation in infection risk shapes the evolution of a Borrelia resistance gene in wild rodents']

The extent of cross-reactivity differed between mouse strains, being higher in C3H than BALB/c and C57BL/6.

Conversely, red-billed oxpeckers exhibited a fuller use of each host and displaced yellow-billed oxpeckers from distal giraffe body parts. These findings highlight that the partition of giraffe hosts in two separate niches was only part of the coexistence story in this species pair.

"['Genetically diverse infections are common but little is known about what effects coinfecting strains have on each other in natural host-parasite systems. To explore the nature and consequences of interactions in the wild, we studied the tick-transmitted bacterium Borrelia afzelii in one of its main reservoir hosts, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. We measured overall infection intensity with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and resolved the composition of multiple infections using strain-specific PCR assays targeting the ospC gene (which encodes an immunodominant surface protein). We found seven different strains, as defined by ospC genotype. There was little evidence for interactions affecting infection intensities, but strains were highly aggregated (i.e., there were more multiple infections than expected from random co-occurrence). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the difference at the amino acid level between two OspC types and their degree of association. Overall, the observed patterns suggest that facilitation is more important than competition in this system and that more diverse infections have an advantage in establishing and/or maintaining infection.

Yet for many wild organisms, age is an inaccessible trait. In many cases measuring age or ageing rates in the wild requires molecular biomarkers of age. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation have been shown to accurately estimate the age of humans and laboratory mice, but they also show variable ticking rates that are associated with mortality risk above and beyond that predicted by chronological age. Thus, epigenetic clocks are proving to be useful markers of both chronological and biological age, and they are beginning to be applied to wild mammals and birds.

"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans.

"['Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) are traditionally regarded as sister to the clade of terrestrial chelicerates (Arachnida). This hypothesis has been challenged by recent phylogenomic analyses,  but the non-monophyly of Arachnida has consistently been disregarded  as artifactual. We reevaluated the placement of Xiphosura among chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic dataset to date, expanding outgroup sampling and including data from whole genome sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in theplacement of some arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is apparent that the radiation of Arachnids is an old one and occurred over a brief  period of time, resulting in several consecutive short internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of incomplete lineage sorting  (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees  to explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were evaluated, as well as the effects of fast  evolving partitions and the dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that the placement of horseshoe crabs can not be explained by missing data, compositional biases, saturation, or incomplete  lineage sorting. Interrogation of the phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic arachnids comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long standing paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat. Future studies testing chelicerate relationships should approach the task with a sampling strategy where the monophyly of Arachnida is not held as the premise.']","[[{'firstName': 'Jesus A.', 'lastName': 'Ballesteros', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}, {'firstName': 'Prashant P.', 'lastName': 'Sharma', 'affiliation': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01y2jtd41'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2g1f4n5'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: A critical appraisal of the placement of Xiphosura (Chelicerata) with account of known sources of phylogenetic error']
"['Pathogen evasion of the host immune system is a key force driving extreme polymorphism in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although this gene family is well characterized in structure and function, there is still much debate surrounding the mechanisms by which MHC diversity is selectively maintained. Many studies have investigated relationships between MHC variation and specific pathogens, and have found mixed support for and against the hypotheses of heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection. Few, however, have focused on the selective effects of multiple parasite types on host immunogenetic patterns. Here, we examined relationships between variation in the equine MHC gene, ELA-DRA, and both gastrointestinal (GI) and ectoparasitism in plains zebras (Equus quagga). Specific alleles present at opposing population frequencies had antagonistic effects, with rare alleles associated with increased GI parasitism and common alleles with increased tick burdens. These results support a frequency-dependent mechanism, but are also consistent with fluctuating selection. Maladaptive GI parasite ‘susceptibility alleles’ were reduced in frequency, suggesting that these parasites may play a greater selective role at this locus. Heterozygote advantage, in terms of allele mutational divergence, also predicted decreased GI parasite burden in genotypes with a common allele. We conclude that an immunogenetic trade-off affects resistance/susceptibility to parasites in this system. Because GI and ectoparasites do not directly interact within hosts, our results uniquely show that antagonistic parasite interactions can be indirectly modulated through the host immune system. This study highlights the importance of investigating the role of multiple parasites in shaping patterns of host immunogenetic variation.']","[[{'firstName': 'Pauline L.', 'lastName': 'Kamath', 'email': 'pauline.kamath@maine.edu', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}, {'firstName': 'Wendy C.', 'lastName': 'Turner', 'affiliation': 'University of Oslo', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01xtthb56'}, {'firstName': 'Martina', 'lastName': 'Küsters', 'affiliation': 'Berkeley Etosha Anthrax Research Project, Swakopmund, Namibia'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne M.', 'lastName': 'Getz', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01an7q238'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p083b'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Parasite-mediated selection drives an immunogenetic tradeoff in plains zebras (Equus quagga)']

To study roles of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, bioinformatic and molecular approaches were carried out. MUMmer genome alignments of whole genome sequence of I. scapularis, a close relative to I. pacificus, against completely sequenced genomes of R. bellii OSU85-389, R. conorii, and R. felis, identified 8,190 unique sequences that are homologous to Rickettsia sequences in the NCBI Trace Archive. MetaCyc metabolic reconstructions revealed that all folate gene orthologues (folA, folC, folE, folKP, ptpS) required for de novo folate biosynthesis are present in the genome of Rickettsia buchneri in I. scapularis. To examine the metabolic capability of phylotype G021 in I. pacificus, genes of the folate biosynthesis pathway of the bacterium were PCR amplified using degenerate primers. BLAST searches identified that nucleotide sequences of the folA, folC, folE, folKP, and ptpS genes possess 98.6%, 98.8%, 98.9%, 98.5% and 99.0% identity respectively to the corresponding genes of Rickettsia buchneri. Phylogenetic tree constructions show that the folate genes of phylotype G021 and homologous genes from various Rickettsia species are monophyletic.

"['The mechanisms underlying honest signal expression remain elusive and may involve the integration of social and physiological costs. Corticosterone is a socially modulated metabolic hormone that mediates energy investment and behavior and may therefore function to deter dishonest signal expression. We examined the relationship between corticosterone and green badge coloration in male sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), hypothesizing that physiological and behavioral costs resulting from elevated baseline glucocorticoids function in maintenance of honest signal expression. We found that large-badged males had higher corticosterone titer, with this relationship apparent at the end of the season and absent early in the season. Large-badged males also suffered higher ectoparasite load (number of tick nymphs), despite being in better condition than small-badged males. Ectoparasite load was positively related to corticosterone titer early in the season at the time of badge formation. High-condition individuals had lower corticosterone and lower numbers of ectoparasites than low-condition individuals, suggestive of conditional variation in ability to withstand costs of corticosterone. We found an opposing negative relationship between corticosterone titer and endoparasite load. Corticosterone titer was also negatively associated with male mobility, a fitness-determining behavior in this species. Because badge size is involved in mediating agonistic social interactions in this species, our results suggest that badge-dependent variation in corticosterone is likely reflective of variation in social conditions experienced over the course of the season. Our results implicate corticosterone in maintenance of signal honesty, both early in the season through enforcement of physiological costs (ectoparasite load) and during the season through behavioral costs (male mobility). We propose that socially modulated variation in corticosterone critically functions in mediation of signal honesty without requiring a direct role for corticosterone in trait expression.']","[[{'firstName': 'Willow R.', 'lastName': 'Lindsay', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Erik', 'lastName': 'Wapstra', 'affiliation': 'University of Tasmania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01nfmeh72'}, {'firstName': 'Bengt', 'lastName': 'Silverin', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences; Göteborg University Göteborg Sweden'}, {'firstName': 'Mats', 'lastName': 'Olsson', 'affiliation': 'University of Sydney', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/0384j8v12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.67136'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Corticosterone: a costly mediator of signal honesty in sand lizards']

Despite their importance, Iraqi cattle have up to now been poorly characterized at genome level. Here, we report at genome-wide level the diversity and signature of positive selection in these two breeds. Thirty-five unrelated Jenoubi cattle, sampled in the Maysan and Basra regions, and 60 Rustaqi cattle, from around Baghdad and Babylon, were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip (700K). Genetic population structure and diversity level were studied using principal component analysis (PCA), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and admixture. Signatures of selection were studied using Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) (iHS and Rsb) and inter-population Wright’s Fst. The results of PCA and admixture analysis, including European taurine, Asian indicine, African indicine and taurine indicate that the two breeds are crossbreed zebu x taurine, with more zebu background in Jenoubi cattle compared to Rustaqi. The Rustaqi has the greatest mean heterozygosity (He = 0.37) among all breeds. iHS and Rsb signature of selection analyses identify 68 candidate genes under positive selection in the two Iraqi breeds, while Fst analysis identifies 220 candidate genes including genes related to the innate and acquired immunity responses, different environmental selection pressures (e.g. tick resistance, heat stress) and genes of commercial interest (e.g. marbling score).']","[[{'firstName': 'Akil Farouk', 'lastName': 'Alshawi'}, {'firstName': 'Abdulameer', 'lastName': 'Essa'}, {'firstName': 'Sahar', 'lastName': 'Al-Bayatti'}, {'firstName': 'Olivier', 'lastName': 'Hanotte'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.t35r32q'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Genome analysis reveals genetic admixture and signature of selection for productivity and environmental traits in Iraqi cattle']

"['<p><span style=""background:white;"">Habitat quality regulates fitness and population density, making it a key driver of population size. Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses “best available science”, extending inferences across taxa, space or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus transitionalis</i>) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (<i>Sylvilagus floridanus</i>),<i> </i>which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex tradeoff between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.</span></p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Amanda', 'lastName': 'Cheeseman', 'email': 'acheesem@esf.edu', 'affiliation': 'SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00qv0tw17', 'orcid': '0000-0002-3744-0945'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9khq'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Survival and density of New England cottontail and Eastern cottontail']
"['The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.']","[[{'firstName': 'Allison L.', 'lastName': 'Hicks', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}, {'firstName': 'Siobain', 'lastName': 'Duffy', 'affiliation': 'Rutgers University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05vt9qd57'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.58ss8'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Cell tropism predicts long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction.

"['Background: Despite considerable effort, progress in spider molecular systematics has lagged behind many other comparable arthropod groups, thereby hindering family-level resolution, classification, and testing of important macroevolutionary hypotheses. Recently, alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches, Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE), is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome, for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders, with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Results: Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci, we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome, three published araneomorph spider genomes, and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit, we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa, 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa, 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus Aphonopelma (83 taxa, 581 loci). At the deepest level, all three major spider lineages (the Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae) were supported with high bootstrap support. Strong support was also found throughout the Euctenizidae, including generic relationships within the family and species relationships within the genus Aptostichus. As in the Euctenizidae, virtually identical topologies were inferred with high support throughout Aphonopelma. Conclusions: The Spider Probe Kit, the first implementation of AHE methodology in Class Arachnida, holds great promise for gathering the types and quantities of molecular data needed to accelerate an understanding of the spider Tree of Life by providing a mechanism whereby different researchers can confidently and effectively use the same loci for independent projects, yet allowing synthesis of data across independent research groups.']","[[{'firstName': 'Chris A.', 'lastName': 'Hamilton', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}, {'firstName': 'Alan R.', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Emily Moriarty', 'lastName': 'Lemmon', 'affiliation': 'Florida State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05g3dte14'}, {'firstName': 'Jason E.', 'lastName': 'Bond', 'affiliation': 'Auburn University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02v80fc35'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.5027d'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Expanding anchored hybrid enrichment to resolve both deep and shallow relationships within the spider tree of life']

"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales. Moreover, we illustrate how species distribution models, in combination with temporally refined species occurrence and environmental data, can be used to investigate environmental factors predictive of geographic variation in seasonality or phenology of vector species.

"['1. Understanding seasonal patterns of activity, or phenology, of vector species is fundamental to determining seasonality of disease risk and epidemics of vector-borne disease. Spatiotemporal variation in abiotic conditions can influence variation in phenological patterns and life history events, which can dramatically influence the ecological role and human impact of a species. For arthropod vectors of human diseases such as ticks, these phenological patterns determine human exposure risk, yet how abiotic conditions interact to determine suitable conditions for host-seeking of vector species is difficult to disentangle. \r\n2. Here we use MaxEnt to model spatial patterns and differences in host-seeking phenology of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) in California using spatially and temporally refined adult tick occurrence data and similarly refined climate and environmental data. We empirically validate the model using phenological data from field studies conducted at sites across California’s latitudinal gradient.\r\n3. We find adult tick host-seeking activity varies substantially throughout the year, as well as across the large latitudinal gradient in the state. Suitable conditions for host-seeking are found earlier in fall and later in the spring in northern than in southern California. These seasonal patterns are primarily associated with monthly precipitation, minimum winter temperature, and winter precipitation, with maximum monthly temperature possibly playing a more prominent role in limiting host-seeking activity earlier in the spring in southern than northern California. \r\n4. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick, we find both a longer window for host-feeding and more protracted risk of human exposure to this vector species in northern than southern California. We further identify key environmental factors associated with these patterns, including precipitation and temperature, that are otherwise challenging to elucidate in field and laboratory studies over large spatial scales. Moreover, we illustrate how species distribution models, in combination with temporally refined species occurrence and environmental data, can be used to investigate environmental factors predictive of geographic variation in seasonality or phenology of vector species. This produces not only novel ecological insight, but key information for public health practitioners in managing vector-borne disease transmission and targeting public outreach and interventions.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald'}, {'firstName': 'Craig', 'lastName': ""O'Neill""}, {'firstName': 'Melissa H.', 'lastName': 'Yoshimizu'}, {'firstName': 'Kerry A.', 'lastName': 'Padgett'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8769t44'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tracking seasonal activity of the western blacklegged tick across California']

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']

Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an emerging pathogen that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen affects cell function in both vertebrate host and the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. Global tissue-specific response and apoptosis signaling pathways were characterized in I. scapularis nymphs and adult female midguts and salivary glands infected with A. phagocytophilum using a systems biology approach combining transcriptomics and proteomics. Apoptosis was selected for pathway-focused analysis due to its role in bacterial infection of tick cells. The results showed tissue-specific differences in tick response to infection and revealed differentiated regulation of apoptosis pathways. The impact of bacterial infection was more pronounced in tick nymphs and midguts than in salivary glands, probably reflecting bacterial developmental cycle. All apoptosis pathways described in other organisms were identified in I. scapularis, except for the absence of the Perforin ortholog. Functional characterization using RNA interference showed that Porin knockdown significantly increases tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. Infection with A. phagocytophilum produced complex tissue-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels. In tick nymphs, the results suggested a possible effect of bacterial infection on the inhibition of tick immune response. In tick midguts, the results suggested that A. phagocytophilum infection inhibited cell apoptosis to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Bacterial infection inhibited the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tick salivary glands by down-regulating Porin expression that resulted in the inhibition of Cytochrome c release as the anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate bacterial infection. However, tick salivary glands may promote apoptosis to limit bacterial infection through induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These dynamic changes in response to A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis tissue-specific transcriptome and proteome demonstrated the complexity of the tick response to infection and will contribute to characterize gene regulation in ticks.']","[[{'firstName': 'Nieves', 'lastName': 'Ayllón', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Margarita', 'lastName': 'Villar', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Ruth C.', 'lastName': 'Galindo', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Katherine M.', 'lastName': 'Kocan', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}, {'firstName': 'Radek', 'lastName': 'Sima', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'Juan A.', 'lastName': 'López', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Jesús', 'lastName': 'Vázquez', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02qs1a797'}, {'firstName': 'Pilar', 'lastName': 'Alberdi', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Alejandro', 'lastName': 'Cabezas-Cruz', 'affiliation': 'Spanish National Research Council', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02gfc7t72'}, {'firstName': 'Petr', 'lastName': 'Kopáček', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Parasitology', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/05rhyza23'}, {'firstName': 'José', 'lastName': 'de la Fuente', 'affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01g9vbr38'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.50kt0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Systems biology of tissue-specific response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum reveals differentiated apoptosis in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis']

After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs.

"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']
"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole. Furthermore, field-acquired bacteria appear to be very important to the overall internal bacterial community of this tick species, with influence from the host bloodmeal appearing limited.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Christine P.', 'lastName': 'Zolnik', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Robert J.', 'lastName': 'Prill', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Richard C.', 'lastName': 'Falco', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas J.', 'lastName': 'Daniels', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Sergios-Orestis', 'lastName': 'Kolokotronis', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mt6m0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Microbiome changes through ontogeny of a tick pathogen vector']

We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors.

Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States.

"['Vector-borne diseases constitute a major global health burden and are increasing in geographic range and prevalence. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that the vector microbiome can impact pathogen dynamics, making the microbiome a focal point in vector-borne disease ecology. However, efforts to generalize preliminary findings across studies and systems and translate these findings into disease control strategies are hindered by a lack of fundamental understanding of the processes shaping the vector microbiome and the interactions therein. Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing and apply a community ecology framework to analyze microbiome community assembly and interactions in Ixodes pacificus, the Lyme disease vector in the western US. We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia. At the scale of the individual I. pacificus, we find support for a highly limited internal microbial community, and propose that the tick endosymbiont may be the most important component of the vector microbiome in influencing pathogen dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Lisa I.', 'lastName': 'Couper'}, {'firstName': 'Jessica Y.', 'lastName': 'Kwan'}, {'firstName': 'Joyce', 'lastName': 'Ma'}, {'firstName': 'Andrea', 'lastName': 'Swei'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2nv32qh'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Drivers and patterns of microbial community assembly in a Lyme disease vector']
"['Zoonotic pathogens that cause devastating morbidity and mortality in humans may be relatively harmless in their natural reservoir hosts. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in humans but few studies have investigated whether this pathogen reduces the fitness of its reservoir hosts under natural conditions. We analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data on a population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, to test whether B. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. B. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector. The estimates of B. burgdorferi infection risk will facilitate future theoretical studies on the epidemiology of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Maarten J.', 'lastName': 'Voordouw', 'affiliation': 'University of Pennsylvania', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00b30xv10'}, {'firstName': 'Shelly', 'lastName': 'Lachish', 'affiliation': 'University of Oxford', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/052gg0110'}, {'firstName': 'Marc C.', 'lastName': 'Dolan', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/042twtr12'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.8bq31'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The Lyme disease pathogen has no effect on the survival of its rodent reservoir host']
"['Background: The prolonged feeding process of ixodid ticks, in combination with bacterial transmission, should lead to a robust inflammatory response at the blood-feeding site. Yet, factors present in tick saliva may down-regulate such responses, which may be beneficial to spirochete transmission. The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that tick saliva, in the context of Borrelia burgdorferi, can have widespread effects on the production of immune mediators in skin.  Methods: A cross-section of tick feeding on skin was examined histologically. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction. Our model suggests land use regulations that reduce parcel size would be an actionable approach for policy makers concerned about increasing Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern US.10-Oct-2018']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'Plantinga', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p7t9289'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Missing the people for the trees: identifying coupled natural-human system feedbacks driving the ecology of Lyme disease']

The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach—occupancy modelling—to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses.

"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.']","[[{'firstName': 'Sarah S.T.', 'lastName': 'Leo'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew', 'lastName': 'Gonzalez'}, {'firstName': 'Virginie', 'lastName': 'Millien'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2n5h6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: The genetic signature of range expansion in a disease vector - the black-legged tick']
"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag.

"['Background: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a cytolytic virulence factor produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes and other Streptococcus species. Related “SLS-like” toxins have been characterized in select strains of Clostridium and Listeria, with homologous clusters bioinformatically identified in a variety of other species. SLS is a member of the thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) family of natural products. The structure of SLS has yet to be deciphered and many questions remain regarding its structure-activity relationships. Results: In this work, we assessed the hemolytic activity of a series of C-terminally truncated SLS peptides expressed in SLS-deficient S. pyogenes. Our data indicate that while the N-terminal poly-heterocyclizable (NPH) region of SLS substantially contributes to its bioactivity, the variable C-terminal region of the toxin is largely dispensable. Through genome mining we identified additional SLS-like clusters in diverse Firmicutes, Spirochaetes and Actinobacteria. Among the Spirochaete clusters, naturally truncated SLS-like precursors were found in the genomes of three Lyme disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) strains. Although unable to restore hemolysis in SLS-deficient S. pyogenes, a Bbsl SLS-like precursor peptide was converted to a cytolysin using purified SLS biosynthetic enzymes. A PCR-based screen demonstrated that SLS-like clusters are substantially more prevalent in Bbsl than inferred from publicly available genome sequences. Conclusions: The mutagenesis data described herein allowed us to define the minimal cytolytic unit of SLS as the NPH region. Interestingly, this region is found in all characterized TOMM cytolysins, as well as the novel putative TOMM cytolysins we discovered. We propose that this conserved region represents the defining feature of the SLS-like TOMM family. We demonstrate the cytolytic potential of a Bbsl SLS-like precursor peptide, which is of similar length to the SLS minimal cytolytic unit, when modified with purified SLS biosynthetic enzymes. As such, we speculate that some Borrelia have the potential to produce a TOMM cytolysin, although the biological significance of this finding remains to be determined.

"['The discovery of the key role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in initiating innate immune responses and modulating adaptive immunity has revolutionised our understanding of vertebrate defence against pathogens. Yet, despite their central role in pathogen recognition and defence initiation, there is little information on how variation in TLRs influences disease susceptibility in natural populations. Here we assessed the extent of naturally occurring polymorphisms at TLR2 in wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and tested for associations between TLR2 variants and infection with Borrelia afzelii, a common tick-transmitted pathogen in rodents and one of the causative agents of human Lyme disease. Bank voles in our population had 15 different TLR2 haplotypes (ten different haplotypes at the amino acid level), which grouped in three well-separated clusters. In a large-scale capture-mark-recapture study we show that voles carrying TLR2 haplotypes of one particular cluster (TLR2c2) were almost three times less likely to be Borrelia-infected than animals carrying other haplotypes. Moreover, neutrality tests suggested that TLR2 has been under positive selection. This is the first demonstration of an association between TLR polymorphism and parasitism in wildlife, and a striking example that genetic variation at innate immune receptors can have a large impact on host resistance.']","[[{'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09'}, {'firstName': 'Martin', 'lastName': 'Andersson', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Kristin', 'lastName': 'Scherman', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Helena', 'lastName': 'Westerdahl', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Peer R.

"['Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities to gain novel insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic trait variation. Yet to date, progress in our understanding of genotype-phenotype associations in non-model organisms in general and natural vertebrate populations in particular has been hampered by small sample sizes typically available for wildlife populations and a resulting lack of statistical power, as well as a limited ability to control for false positive signals. Here we propose to combine a genome-wide association (GWAS) and FST-based approach with population-level replication to partly overcome these limitations. We present a case study in which we used this approach in combination with Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) SNP data to identify genomic regions associated with Borrelia afzelii resistance or susceptibility in the natural rodent host of this Lyme disease-causing spirochete, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Using this combined approach we identified four consensus SNPs located in exonic regions of the genes Slc26a4, Tns3, Wscd1 and Espnl, which were significantly associated with the voles’ Borrelia infectious status within and across populations. Functional links between host responses to bacterial infections and most of these genes have previously been demonstrated in other rodent systems, making them promising new candidates for the study of evolutionary host responses to Borrelia emergence. Our approach is applicable to other systems and may facilitate the identification of genetic variants underlying disease resistance or susceptibility, as well as other ecologically relevant traits, in wildlife populations.']","[[{'firstName': 'Luca', 'lastName': 'Cornetti', 'email': 'luca.cornetti@unibas.ch', 'affiliation': 'University of Basel', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02s6k3f65', 'orcid': '0000-0002-7188-4048'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'email': 'b.tschirren@exeter.ac.uk', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09', 'orcid': '0000-0003-4806-4102'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.c866t1g3t'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Combining GWAS and FST-based approaches to identify targets of Borrelia-mediated selection in natural rodent hosts']
"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l. Our findings underscore the importance of bird behavior to explain local tick infestation and Borrelia infection in these animals, and suggest the potential for bird-mediated geographic spread of vector ticks and spirochetes in the far-western United States.']","[[{'firstName': 'Erica A.', 'lastName': 'Newman', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Eisen', 'affiliation': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03k1gpj17'}, {'firstName': 'Rebecca J.', 'lastName': 'Eisen', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/042twtr12'}, {'firstName': 'Natalia', 'lastName': 'Fedorova', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Jeomhee M.', 'lastName': 'Hasty', 'affiliation': 'Hawaii Department of Health', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00kgerq53'}, {'firstName': 'Charles', 'lastName': 'Vaughn', 'affiliation': 'University of California Hopland Research & Extension Center, Hopland, CA 95449, United States of America'}, {'firstName': 'Robert S.', 'lastName': 'Lane', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p3b61'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes in wild birds in northwestern California: associations with ecological factors, bird behavior and tick infestation']"

"['The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00f54p054'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6g33308'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Abiotic and habitat drivers of tick vector abundance, diversity, phenology and human encounter risk in southern California']"

Protein and peptide microarrays now provide a high-throughput platform for immunological screening of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes.

In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize antigenic targets starting from a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization, presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure, transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We applied this method to the prioritization of potential diagnostic antigens and peptides in a number of pathogen proteomes and human diseases: Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Brucella melitensis (Brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Escherichia coli (Gastroenteritis), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), Leishmania braziliensis (Leishmaniasis), Leptospira interrogans (Leptospirosis), Mycobacterium leprae (Leprae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tuberculosis), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Periodontal disease), Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteremia), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcal infections), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease).

"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole. Furthermore, field-acquired bacteria appear to be very important to the overall internal bacterial community of this tick species, with influence from the host bloodmeal appearing limited.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Christine P.', 'lastName': 'Zolnik', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Robert J.', 'lastName': 'Prill', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Richard C.', 'lastName': 'Falco', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas J.', 'lastName': 'Daniels', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Sergios-Orestis', 'lastName': 'Kolokotronis', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mt6m0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Microbiome changes through ontogeny of a tick pathogen vector']
"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans. We found two significant associations between DQB haplotypes and infection status: one haplotype was associated with lower risk of infection (resistance), while another was associated with higher risk of infection (susceptibility). Interestingly, allelic divergence within individuals was higher for voles with the resistance haplotype compared to other voles. In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles. The pattern of higher allelic divergence in individuals with the resistance haplotype is consistent with NFDS favouring divergent alleles in a natural population, hence selection where DAA works in concert with NFDS.\xa0</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Kristin', 'lastName': 'Scherman', 'email': 'kristin.scherman@icloud.com', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Råberg', 'email': 'lars.raberg@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Helena', 'lastName': 'Westerdahl', 'email': 'helena.westerdahl@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.x69p8czjj'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Borrelia infection in bank voles Myodes glareolus is associated with specific DQB haplotypes which affect allelic divergence within individuals']

"['Vector-borne diseases constitute a major global health burden and are increasing in geographic range and prevalence. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that the vector microbiome can impact pathogen dynamics, making the microbiome a focal point in vector-borne disease ecology. However, efforts to generalize preliminary findings across studies and systems and translate these findings into disease control strategies are hindered by a lack of fundamental understanding of the processes shaping the vector microbiome and the interactions therein. Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing and apply a community ecology framework to analyze microbiome community assembly and interactions in Ixodes pacificus, the Lyme disease vector in the western US. We find that vertical and environmental transmission routes drive population-level patterns in I. pacificus microbial diversity and composition, but not in microbial function and overall abundance. Further we find that the I. pacificus microbiome is not strongly structured based on competition but assembles non-randomly, likely due to vector-specific filtering processes which largely eliminate all but the dominant endosymbiont, Rickettsia. At the scale of the individual I. pacificus, we find support for a highly limited internal microbial community, and propose that the tick endosymbiont may be the most important component of the vector microbiome in influencing pathogen dynamics.']","[[{'firstName': 'Lisa I.', 'lastName': 'Couper'}, {'firstName': 'Jessica Y.', 'lastName': 'Kwan'}, {'firstName': 'Joyce', 'lastName': 'Ma'}, {'firstName': 'Andrea', 'lastName': 'Swei'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.2nv32qh'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Drivers and patterns of microbial community assembly in a Lyme disease vector']

The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in humans but few studies have investigated whether this pathogen reduces the fitness of its reservoir hosts under natural conditions. We analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data on a population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, to test whether B. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. B. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector.

"['Background: The prolonged feeding process of ixodid ticks, in combination with bacterial transmission, should lead to a robust inflammatory response at the blood-feeding site. Yet, factors present in tick saliva may down-regulate such responses, which may be beneficial to spirochete transmission. The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that tick saliva, in the context of Borrelia burgdorferi, can have widespread effects on the production of immune mediators in skin.  Methods: A cross-section of tick feeding on skin was examined histologically. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with B. burgdorferi and grown in the presence or absence of tick saliva were examined by human DNA microarray, cytokine bead array, sandwich ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Similar experiments were also conducted using dermal fibroblasts.  Results: Tick feeding on skin showed dermal infiltration of histiocytes and granulocytes at the bite location. Changes in monocytic transcript levels during co-culture with B. burgdorferi and saliva indicated that tick saliva had a suppressive effect on the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 (CXCL8) and TLR2, but had a stimulatory effect on specific molecules such as the Interleukin 10 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-10RA), a known mediator of the immunosuppressive signal of IL-10. Stimulated cell culture supernatants were analyzed via antigen-capture ELISA and cytokine bead array for inflammatory mediator production. Treatment of monocytes with saliva significantly reduced the expression of several key mediators including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Tick saliva had an opposite effect on dermal fibroblasts. Rather than inhibiting, saliva enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6 from these sentinel skin cells.  Conclusions: The effects of ixodid tick saliva on resident skin cells is cell type-dependent. The response to both tick and pathogen at the site of feeding favors pathogen transmission, but may not be wholly suppressed by tick saliva.']","[[{'firstName': 'Dorothy C.', 'lastName': 'Scholl'}, {'firstName': 'Monica E.', 'lastName': 'Embers'}, {'firstName': 'John R.', 'lastName': 'Caskey'}, {'firstName': 'Deepak', 'lastName': 'Kaushal'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas N.', 'lastName': 'Mather'}, {'firstName': 'Wayne R.', 'lastName': 'Buck'}, {'firstName': 'Lisa A.', 'lastName': 'Morici'}, {'firstName': 'Mario T.', 'lastName': 'Philipp'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.s1bg6'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva on dermal cells exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease']"
"['The tick Ixodes ricinus finds its hosts by climbing vegetation and adopting a sit-and-wait tactic. This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.']","[[{'firstName': 'Joseph L.', 'lastName': 'Tomkins', 'affiliation': 'University of Western Australia', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047272k79'}, {'firstName': 'Jennifer', 'lastName': 'Aungier', 'affiliation': 'University of Aberdeen', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/016476m91'}, {'firstName': 'Wade N.', 'lastName': 'Hazel', 'affiliation': 'DePauw University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02mks6v46'}, {'firstName': 'Lucy', 'lastName': 'Gilbert', 'affiliation': 'James Hutton Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03rzp5127'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.9p40s'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Towards an evolutionary understanding of questing behaviour in the tick Ixodes ricinus']
"['1. Infectious diseases are rapidly emerging and many are increasing in incidence across the globe. Processes of land-use change, notably habitat loss and fragmentation, have been widely implicated in emergence and spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, yet evidence remains equivocal.\r\n2. Here we discuss and apply an innovative approach from the social sciences, instrumental variables, that seeks to tease out causality from observational data. Using this approach, we revisit the effect of forest fragmentation on Lyme disease incidence, focusing on human interaction with fragmented landscapes. Though human interaction with infected ticks is of clear and fundamental importance to human disease incidence, human activities that influence exposure have been nearly universally overlooked in the ecology literature. 3. Using county-level land-use and Lyme disease incidence data for ~800 counties from the northeastern United States over the span of a decade, we illustrate (1) human interaction with fragmented forest landscapes reliably predicts Lyme disease incidence, while ecological measures of forest fragmentation alone are unreliable predictors and (2) that identifying the effect of forest fragmentation on human disease requires addressing the feedback between Lyme disease risk and human decisions to avoid interaction with high-risk landscapes. 4. Synthesis and applications. The innovative approach and novel results help to clarify the equivocal literature on forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and illustrate the key role that human behavior may be playing in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America. Accounting for human activity and behavior in the ecology of disease more broadly may result in improved understanding of both the ecological drivers of disease, as well as actionable intervention strategies to reduce disease burden in a changing world. For example, our model results have practical implications for land-use policy aimed at disease reduction. Our model suggests land use regulations that reduce parcel size would be an actionable approach for policy makers concerned about increasing Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern US.10-Oct-2018']","[[{'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'MacDonald', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Ashley E.', 'lastName': 'Larsen', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}, {'firstName': 'Andrew J.', 'lastName': 'Plantinga', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Santa Barbara', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02t274463'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p7t9289'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Missing the people for the trees: identifying coupled natural-human system feedbacks driving the ecology of Lyme disease']

By applying a classic ecological approach—occupancy modelling—to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved.

"['Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 years of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer two years prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health.']","[[{'firstName': 'Richard S.', 'lastName': 'Ostfeld', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Taal', 'lastName': 'Levi', 'affiliation': 'Oregon State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00ysfqy60'}, {'firstName': 'Felicia', 'lastName': 'Keesing', 'affiliation': 'Bard College', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04yrgt058'}, {'firstName': 'Kelly', 'lastName': 'Oggenfuss', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}, {'firstName': 'Charles D.', 'lastName': 'Canham', 'affiliation': 'Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01dhcyx48'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d1c8046'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Tick-borne disease risk in a forest food web']

"['Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones.

"['Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. B. afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne B. garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995-2017, we show here that 69 % of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21 %). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag.

"['Background: Streptolysin S (SLS) is a cytolytic virulence factor produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes and other Streptococcus species. Related “SLS-like” toxins have been characterized in select strains of Clostridium and Listeria, with homologous clusters bioinformatically identified in a variety of other species. SLS is a member of the thiazole/oxazole-modified microcin (TOMM) family of natural products. The structure of SLS has yet to be deciphered and many questions remain regarding its structure-activity relationships. Results: In this work, we assessed the hemolytic activity of a series of C-terminally truncated SLS peptides expressed in SLS-deficient S. pyogenes. Our data indicate that while the N-terminal poly-heterocyclizable (NPH) region of SLS substantially contributes to its bioactivity, the variable C-terminal region of the toxin is largely dispensable. Through genome mining we identified additional SLS-like clusters in diverse Firmicutes, Spirochaetes and Actinobacteria. Among the Spirochaete clusters, naturally truncated SLS-like precursors were found in the genomes of three Lyme disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) strains. Although unable to restore hemolysis in SLS-deficient S. pyogenes, a Bbsl SLS-like precursor peptide was converted to a cytolysin using purified SLS biosynthetic enzymes. A PCR-based screen demonstrated that SLS-like clusters are substantially more prevalent in Bbsl than inferred from publicly available genome sequences. Conclusions: The mutagenesis data described herein allowed us to define the minimal cytolytic unit of SLS as the NPH region. Interestingly, this region is found in all characterized TOMM cytolysins, as well as the novel putative TOMM cytolysins we discovered. We propose that this conserved region represents the defining feature of the SLS-like TOMM family. We demonstrate the cytolytic potential of a Bbsl SLS-like precursor peptide, which is of similar length to the SLS minimal cytolytic unit, when modified with purified SLS biosynthetic enzymes. As such, we speculate that some Borrelia have the potential to produce a TOMM cytolysin, although the biological significance of this finding remains to be determined. In addition to providing new insight into the structure-activity relationships of SLS, this study greatly expands the cytolysin group of TOMMs.']","[[{'firstName': 'Evelyn M.', 'lastName': 'Molloy', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Sherwood R.', 'lastName': 'Casajens', 'affiliation': 'University of Utah', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03r0ha626'}, {'firstName': 'Courtney L.', 'lastName': 'Cox', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Tucker', 'lastName': 'Maxson', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Nicole A.', 'lastName': 'Ethridge', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}, {'firstName': 'Gabriele', 'lastName': 'Margos', 'affiliation': 'Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, National Reference Centre for Borrelia, Oberschleissheim, Germany'}, {'firstName': 'Volker', 'lastName': 'Fingerle', 'affiliation': 'Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, National Reference Centre for Borrelia, Oberschleissheim, Germany'}, {'firstName': 'Douglas A.', 'lastName': 'Mitchell', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/047426m28'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.d4863'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Identification of the Minimal Cytolytic Unit for Streptolysin S and an Expansion of the Toxin Family']

Yet to date, progress in our understanding of genotype-phenotype associations in non-model organisms in general and natural vertebrate populations in particular has been hampered by small sample sizes typically available for wildlife populations and a resulting lack of statistical power, as well as a limited ability to control for false positive signals. Here we propose to combine a genome-wide association (GWAS) and FST-based approach with population-level replication to partly overcome these limitations. We present a case study in which we used this approach in combination with Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) SNP data to identify genomic regions associated with Borrelia afzelii resistance or susceptibility in the natural rodent host of this Lyme disease-causing spirochete, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Using this combined approach we identified four consensus SNPs located in exonic regions of the genes Slc26a4, Tns3, Wscd1 and Espnl, which were significantly associated with the voles’ Borrelia infectious status within and across populations. Functional links between host responses to bacterial infections and most of these genes have previously been demonstrated in other rodent systems, making them promising new candidates for the study of evolutionary host responses to Borrelia emergence. Our approach is applicable to other systems and may facilitate the identification of genetic variants underlying disease resistance or susceptibility, as well as other ecologically relevant traits, in wildlife populations.']","[[{'firstName': 'Luca', 'lastName': 'Cornetti', 'email': 'luca.cornetti@unibas.ch', 'affiliation': 'University of Basel', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/02s6k3f65', 'orcid': '0000-0002-7188-4048'}, {'firstName': 'Barbara', 'lastName': 'Tschirren', 'email': 'b.tschirren@exeter.ac.uk', 'affiliation': 'University of Exeter', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03yghzc09', 'orcid': '0000-0003-4806-4102'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.c866t1g3t'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Combining GWAS and FST-based approaches to identify targets of Borrelia-mediated selection in natural rodent hosts']
"['Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l. Our findings underscore the importance of bird behavior to explain local tick infestation and Borrelia infection in these animals, and suggest the potential for bird-mediated geographic spread of vector ticks and spirochetes in the far-western United States.']","[[{'firstName': 'Erica A.', 'lastName': 'Newman', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Eisen', 'affiliation': 'Colorado State University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03k1gpj17'}, {'firstName': 'Rebecca J.', 'lastName': 'Eisen', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/042twtr12'}, {'firstName': 'Natalia', 'lastName': 'Fedorova', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}, {'firstName': 'Jeomhee M.', 'lastName': 'Hasty', 'affiliation': 'Hawaii Department of Health', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00kgerq53'}, {'firstName': 'Charles', 'lastName': 'Vaughn', 'affiliation': 'University of California Hopland Research & Extension Center, Hopland, CA 95449, United States of America'}, {'firstName': 'Robert S.', 'lastName': 'Lane', 'affiliation': 'University of California System', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/00pjdza24'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.p3b61'],['dataset'],[''],[''],"['Data from: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes in wild birds in northwestern California: associations with ecological factors, bird behavior and tick infestation']"

"['<p>Availability of highly parallelized immunoassays has renewed interest in the discovery of serology-based biomarkers for infectious diseases. Protein and peptide microarrays now provide a high-throughput platform for immunological screening of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes. However, there is still a need to prioritize relevant probes when designing these arrays. In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize antigenic targets starting from a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization, presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure, transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We applied this method to the prioritization of potential diagnostic antigens and peptides in a number of pathogen proteomes and human diseases: Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Brucella melitensis (Brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Escherichia coli (Gastroenteritis), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), Leishmania braziliensis (Leishmaniasis), Leptospira interrogans (Leptospirosis), Mycobacterium leprae (Leprae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tuberculosis), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Periodontal disease), Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteremia), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcal infections), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease). After training a linear regression model the method achieves good to excellent\xa0performance on most species, measured by the enrichment of validated antigens at the top of the ranking.

"[""Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are one of the most important pathogen vectors in the United States, responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The structure of a host's microbial community has the potential to affect the ecology and evolution of the host. We employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 hypervariable regions in the first study to investigate the tick microbiome across all developmental stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). In addition to field-collected life stages, newly hatched laboratory-reared larvae were studied to determine the baseline microbial community structure and to assess transovarial transmission. We also targeted midguts and salivary glands due to their importance in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Over 100 000 sequences were produced per life stage replicate. Rickettsia was the most abundant bacterial genus across all sample types matching mostly the Ixodes rickettsial endosymbionts, and its proportion decreased as developmental stage progressed, with the exception of adult females that harboured a mean relative abundance of 97.9%. Laboratory-reared larvae displayed the lowest bacterial diversity, containing almost exclusively Rickettsia. Many of the remaining bacteria included genera associated with soil, water and plants, suggesting environmental acquisition while off-host. Female organs exhibited significantly different β-diversity than the whole tick from which they were derived. Our results demonstrate clear differences in both α- and β-diversity among tick developmental stages and between tick organs and the tick as a whole. Furthermore, field-acquired bacteria appear to be very important to the overall internal bacterial community of this tick species, with influence from the host bloodmeal appearing limited.""]","[[{'firstName': 'Christine P.', 'lastName': 'Zolnik', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Robert J.', 'lastName': 'Prill', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Richard C.', 'lastName': 'Falco', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Thomas J.', 'lastName': 'Daniels', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}, {'firstName': 'Sergios-Orestis', 'lastName': 'Kolokotronis', 'affiliation': 'Fordham University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/03qnxaf80'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.mt6m0'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Microbiome changes through ontogeny of a tick pathogen vector']
"['<p>The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele–pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS\xa0though this is yet to be tested explicitly.\xa0To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (<i>Myodes glareolus</i>) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by\xa0<i>Borrelia afzelii</i>, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans. We found two significant associations between DQB haplotypes and infection status: one haplotype was associated with lower risk of infection (resistance), while another was associated with higher risk of infection (susceptibility). Interestingly, allelic divergence within individuals was higher for voles with the resistance haplotype compared to other voles. In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles. The pattern of higher allelic divergence in individuals with the resistance haplotype is consistent with NFDS favouring divergent alleles in a natural population, hence selection where DAA works in concert with NFDS.\xa0</p>\r\n']","[[{'firstName': 'Kristin', 'lastName': 'Scherman', 'email': 'kristin.scherman@icloud.com', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Lars', 'lastName': 'Råberg', 'email': 'lars.raberg@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}, {'firstName': 'Helena', 'lastName': 'Westerdahl', 'email': 'helena.westerdahl@biol.lu.se', 'affiliation': 'Lund University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/012a77v79'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.x69p8czjj'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Borrelia infection in bank voles Myodes glareolus is associated with specific DQB haplotypes which affect allelic divergence within individuals']

"['Predators and competitors of vertebrates can in theory reduce the density of infected nymphs (DIN)—an often-used measure of tick-borne disease risk—by lowering the density of reservoir-competent hosts and/or the tick burden on reservoir-competent hosts. We investigated this possible indirect effect of predators by comparing data from 20 forest plots across the Netherlands that varied in predator abundance. In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens.

"['Predators and competitors of vertebrates can in theory reduce the density of infected nymphs (DIN)—an often-used measure of tick-borne disease risk—by lowering the density of reservoir-competent hosts and/or the tick burden on reservoir-competent hosts. We investigated this possible indirect effect of predators by comparing data from 20 forest plots across the Netherlands that varied in predator abundance. In each plot, we measured the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs (DON), DIN for three pathogens, rodent density, the tick burden on rodents and the activity of mammalian predators. We analysed whether rodent density and tick burden on rodents were correlated with predator activity, and how rodent density and tick burden predicted DON and DIN for the three pathogens. We found that larval burden on two rodent species decreased with activity of two predator species, while DON and DIN for all three pathogens increased with larval burden on rodents, as predicted. Path analyses supported an indirect negative correlation of activity of both predator species with DON and DIN. Our results suggest that predators can indeed lower the number of ticks feeding on reservoir-competent hosts, which implies that changes in predator abundance may have cascading effects on tick-borne disease risk.']","[[{'firstName': 'Tim R.', 'lastName': 'Hofmeester', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Patrick A.', 'lastName': 'Jansen', 'affiliation': 'Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/035jbxr46'}, {'firstName': 'Hendrikus J.', 'lastName': 'Wijnen', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Elena C.', 'lastName': 'Coipan', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Manoj', 'lastName': 'Fonville', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Herbert H.T.', 'lastName': 'Prins', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Hein', 'lastName': 'Sprong', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01cesdt21'}, {'firstName': 'Sip E.', 'lastName': 'van Wieren', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University & Research', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/04qw24q55'}, {'firstName': 'Herbert H.

"['Invasive species may impact pathogen transmission by altering the distributions and interactions among native vertebrate reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors. Here, we examined the direct and indirect effects of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) on the native tick, small mammal and pathogen community in southeast Texas. Using a replicated large-scale field manipulation study, we show that small mammals were more abundant on treatment plots where S. invicta populations were experimentally reduced. Our analysis of ticks on small mammal hosts demonstrated a threefold increase in the ticks caught per unit effort on treatment relative to control plots, and elevated tick loads (a 27-fold increase) on one common rodent species. We detected only one known human pathogen (Rickettsia parkeri), present in 1.4% of larvae and 6.7% of nymph on-host Amblyomma maculatum samples but with no significant difference between treatment and control plots. Given that host and vector population dynamics are key drivers of pathogen transmission, the reduced small mammal and tick abundance associated with S. invicta may alter pathogen transmission dynamics over broader spatial scales.']","[[{'firstName': 'Adrian A.', 'lastName': 'Castellanos', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Matthew C.I.', 'lastName': 'Medeiros', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Gabriel L.', 'lastName': 'Hamer', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Mike E.', 'lastName': 'Morrow', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Micky D.', 'lastName': 'Eubanks', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Pete D.', 'lastName': 'Teel', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Sarah A.', 'lastName': 'Hamer', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}, {'firstName': 'Jessica E.', 'lastName': 'Light', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'affiliationROR': 'https://ror.org/01f5ytq51'}]]",['doi:10.5061/dryad.6968k'],['dataset'],[''],[''],['Data from: Decreased small mammal and on-host tick abundance in association with invasive red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta)']

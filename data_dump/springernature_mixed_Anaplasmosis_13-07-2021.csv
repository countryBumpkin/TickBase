He also recommends a policy to adopt mobile phones for use as both the technology solution and access devices solution, and adds that renewable energy solutions, particularly solar energy, must be advanced to ensure availability of electricity for all residents, a necessity for education and skill development.']","['Sebusang, S.']",['10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],[''],['Cloud-Based Solutions for Education and Skill Development – Botswana']
"['Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can enhance understanding of global biodiversity by making it possible to study taxonomic groups that are difficult to sample. However, experimental choices made when generating eDNA data can impact biodiversity surveys and must be carefully considered during study design. Here, we explored the impact of DNA extraction protocol and metabarcode choice on recovery of meiofauna DNA from sand. We extracted DNA from untreated sand and from sand treated with either Ludox or MgCl 2 and amplified DNA using the 18S and CO1 metabarcodes. We found differences in species composition and richness both between metabarcodes and among sampling strategies, confirming the sensitivity of the experiments to both parameters. Combining data from multiple barcodes and from multiple extraction protocols increased recovered meiofaunal taxonomic diversity. Future metabarcoding studies and meta-analyses should consider the effects of sampling protocols on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the need to continue to improve existing reference databases of morphological and molecular characterization of meiofauna, in particular of the tropics, which are poorly represented in existing databases.']","['Castro, Lyda R., [Meyer, Rachel S.], [Shapiro, Beth], [Shirazi, Sabrina], [Cutler, Samuel], [Lagos, Ana M.], [Quiroga, Sigmer Y.]']",['10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],[''],['Metabarcoding meiofauna biodiversity assessment in four beaches of Northern Colombia: effects of sampling protocols and primer choice']
"['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great attentions over the past few decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Crystallization is sought in many application fields since it allows enhancing or even promoting properties of catalysis, energy storage and photoelectric properties. However, the crystallization process of nanostructured COFs remains to be challenging. Synthetic approaches to establish nucleation and elongation growth of COFs for controlling crystallization have drawn substantial amount of attentions. Nanostructured COFs have exhibited significant advantages when applied in (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices as well. In this review, recent progress in precisely design strategy of fabricating various nanostructured COFs and their applications as (electro)photocatalyzer and energy storage devices are summarized. After a brief introduction of the design principles, composition and interior architecture, the morphology of nanostructured COFs including porous and mesoporous stacked-layer structure, nanosheet structure, nanorod structure, ordered stripe arrays and various nanocomposites are thoroughly described. Reactions dedicated to crystallization process for two-dimensional (2D) COFs are discussed further. Then, the applications of nanostructured COFs as (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges for the synthetic technology of nanostructured COFs materials are particularly discussed. Personal insights into the challenges and opportunities on pursuing topologies as hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk–shell structures were raised to broaden the applications.']","['Chen, Haoyun, [Yuan, Xingzhong], [Wang, Hou], [Yu, Hanbo], [Jiang, Longbo]']",['10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],[''],['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks with elevated crystallization for (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices']
"['According to modern classification, tick-borne flaviviruses have been divided into a mammalian tick-borne virus group and a seabird tick-borne virus group (STBVG). The STBVG includes the Tyuleniy virus, Meaban virus, Saumarez Reef virus, and the recently discovered Kama virus (KAMV). The latter was isolated from Ixodes lividus , an obligate parasitic tick of the sand martin ( Riparia riparia ), in 1989 in the central part of the Russian Plain. In 2014, based on molecular genetic analysis, it was shown that KAMV is a new virus belonging to STBVG, genus Flavivirus , fam. Flaviviridae . Very little is known about the Kama virus concerning its range, vectors, and reservoir hosts. GenBank contains a single sequence of the complete genome of this virus. In the present study, the complete genome sequences of two strains, isolated in 1983 in the Omsk region (Western Siberia) from gamasid mites in the nests of rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ), have been determined. Phylogenetic analyses of their genomes showed a close relationship both with each other (approx. 98.9% nucleotide identity) and with KAMV isolated in European Russia (approx. 98.4% nucleotide identity). The ecological features of KAMV that are due to the species of the vector (gamasid mites) and its hosts (colonial birds of the mainland of Eurasia) indicate that KAMV is an atypical representative STBVG.']","['Kovalev, S.

Our analysis is based on administrative county-level data on vaccination purchases linked to indicators of media coverage of the meningococcal disease and to administrative records of disease incidence.

"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 117:32493, 2020a), where we reported that BCP/BCPO (beta-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide) in fresh horse manure is sufficient to drive manure rolling behavior (HMR) in giant panda and attenuate the cold sensitivity of mice by directly targeting and inhibiting transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an archetypical cold-activated ion channel of mammals. The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']
"['Probability of informed trading (PIN) models characterize trading with certain types of information through a tree structure. Different tree structures with different numbers of groups for market participants have been proposed, with no clear, consistent tree used in the literature. One of the main causes of this inconsistency is that these trees are artificially proposed through a bottom-up approach rather than implied by actual market data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that infers a tree structure directly from empirical data. More precisely, we use hierarchical clustering to construct a tree for each individual firm and then infer an aggregate tree through a voting mechanism. We test this method on US data from January 2002 for 7608 companies, which results in a tree with two layers and four groups. The characteristics of the resulting aggregate tree are between those of several proposed tree structures in the literature, demonstrating that these proposed trees all reflect only part of the market, and one should consider the proposed empirically driven method when seeking a tree representing the whole market.']","['Lin, Emily, [Kao, Chu-Lan Michael], [Adityarini, Natasha Sonia]']",['10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],[''],['Data-driven tree structure for PIN models']
"['The aim of this study was to explore the associations between temperamental reactivity and regulation and the emergence of anxiety traits in a longitudinal sample of infants enriched for later ASD. Parents of 143 infants who were at high- and low-risk for ASD rated their child’s temperament traits when they were 9, 15 and 24\xa0months old; they rated anxiety and ASD traits when they were 36\xa0months old. The findings suggest that behavioural inhibition may be an early predictor of later anxiety in children with and without ASD and that lower levels of effortful control in children who later develop ASD may contribute to the higher expression of anxiety within this population.']","['Ersoy, Mutluhan, [Charman, Tony], [Pasco, Greg], [Carr, Ewan], [Johnson, Mark H.], [Jones, Emily J.

"['Mating with the wrong species is surprisingly common in nature. Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

"['Free-ranging giant pandas ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) in China recently were reported to rub and roll in horse manure, a behavior that was observed frequently at low ambient temperatures.

Mice\xa0and rats treated with BCP/BCPO exhibited enhanced cold tolerance in behavioral assays, and BCP/BCPO inhibited cold-activated ion channels of mammals expressed in human kidney cells; these laboratory results were cited in support of the contention that giant pandas tolerate low ambient temperatures by applying horse manure to their integument. The demonstrated biocidal activities of BCP and BCPO against insects and ticks, and the reported elicitation of anointing in giant pandas with materials other than horse manure, including substances or constituents thereof known to act as arthropod biocides, are consistent with an anti-consumer function of anointing by giant pandas.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions.

Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Purpose Women’s worry about developing breast cancer may influence their decision to use preventive therapy. However, the direction of this relationship has been questioned. We prospectively investigated the relationship between breast cancer worry and uptake of preventive therapy. The socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with high breast cancer worry were also investigated. Methods Women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited from clinics across England ( n \u2009=\u2009408). Participants completed a survey on their breast cancer worry, socio-demographic and clinical factors. Uptake of tamoxifen was recorded at 3\xa0months ( n \u2009=\u2009258 women, 63.2%). Both primary and sensitivity analyses were conducted using different classifications of low, medium and high worry. Results 39.5% of respondents reported medium breast cancer worry at baseline and 21.2% reported high worry. Ethnic minority women were more likely to report high worry than white women (OR\u2009=\u20093.02, 95%CI 1.02, 8.91, p \u2009=\u20090.046). Women educated below degree level were more likely to report high worry than those with higher education (OR\u2009=\u20092.29, 95%CI 1.28, 4.09, p \u2009=\u20090.005). No statistically significant association was observed between worry and uptake.

"['Aims CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes. It is currently unclear whether daily glucose variability contributes to CVD. Therefore, we investigated whether glucose variability is associated with arterial measures that are considered important in CVD pathogenesis. Methods We included participants of The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort, who underwent at least 48\xa0h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ( n \u2009=\u2009853; age: 59.9\u2009±\u20098.6\xa0years; 49% women, 23% type 2 diabetes). We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

This survey was created to illuminate which and how qMRI techniques are currently applied across Europe. Methods In total, 4753 neuroradiologists from 27 countries received an online questionnaire. Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85). QIBA and EIBALL were not well known (12.5%, n = 34, and 11.0%, n = 30). Conclusions The clinical implementation of qMRI methods is highly variable. Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']
"['Experimental closure of the surface energy balance during convective periods is a long-standing problem. With experimental data from the Idealized horizontal Planar Array experiment for Quantifying Surface heterogeneity, the terms of the temperature-tendency equation are computed, with an emphasis on the total derivative. The experiment occurred at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test facility at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground during the summer of 2019. The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ).

A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings.

The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001).

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"

"['The large integration of variable energy resources is expected to shift a large part of the energy exchanges closer to real-time, where more accurate forecasts are available. In this context, the short-term electricity markets and in particular the intraday market are considered a suitable trading floor for these exchanges to occur. A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']

CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution into constituent cell types. CIM-seq estimates parameters such as number of cells and cell types in each multiplet directly from sequencing data, making it compatible with high-throughput droplet-based methods. When applied to gut epithelium or whole dissociated lung and spleen, CIM-seq correctly identifies known interactions, including those between different cell lineages and immune cells. In the colon, CIM-seq identifies a previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1 , which is directly adjacent to colonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that CIM-seq is broadly applicable to unsupervised profiling of cell-type interactions in different tissue types.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum . This study provides crucial information for ungulate management as a tool to mitigate zoonotic disease risk and argues for adapting management approaches to the local ungulate species composition and the pathogen(s) of concern.

Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks play a vital role as vectors in the transmission of Anaplasma pathogens. However, the Anaplasma species carried by H. longicornis in China are yet to be characterized. In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools. All tick sample pools were examined for the presence of Anaplasma species via nested PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA, major surface protein 4 ( msp4 ), or citric acid synthase ( gltA ) genes, which were sequenced to determine the molecular and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolates. The overall Anaplasma spp-positive rate of H. longicornis was determined to be 26.68% (99/371). The percentage prevalence of A. phagocytophilum -like1, A. bovis , A. ovis , A. marginale , and A. capra were 1.08% (4/371), 13.21% (49/371), 13.21% (49/371), 1.35% (5/371), and 10.24% (38/371), respectively, and the co-infection rate of two or more types of Anaplasma was 6.47% (24/371). Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of A. phagocytophilum into an A. phagocytophilum -like1 ( Anaplasma sp. Japan) group. Anaplasma bovis sequences obtained in this study were 99.8–100% identical to those of an earlier strain isolated from a Chinese tick (GenBank accession no. KP314251). Anaplasma ovis sequences showed 99.3–99.6% identity to an A. ovis human strain identified from a Cypriot patient (GenBank accession no. FJ460443). Only one msp4 sequence of A. marginale was detected and was grouped with those of other A. marginale isolates, and these A. capra isolates obtained in this present study may be zoonotic. The detection and characterization of four Anaplasma species in H. longicornis in this study have added to the current knowledge of the parasite and provided data on multiple Anaplasma species with veterinary and medical significance from four provinces of China.']","['Yan, Yaqun, [Wang, Kunlun], [Cui, Yanyan], [Zhou, Yongchun], [Zhao, Shanshan], [Zhang, Yajun], [Jian, Fuchun], [Wang, Rongjun], [Zhang, Longxian], [Ning, Changshen]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],[''],['Molecular detection and phylogenetic analyses of Anaplasma spp. in Haemaphysalis longicornis from goats in four provinces of China']
"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks. We believe that this approach will aid in large-scale pathogen screening of arthropods to be used in vector-borne disease control programs.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease.

Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases.

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world. Conclusions Despite holding much significance to the animal sector, comprehensive disease mapping has yet not been undertaken in several parts of India. The present study provides a blue print of disease mapping, epidemiological correlations and genomic diversity of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata circulating in the region.']","['Kaur, Rabjot, [Yadav, Anish], [Rafiqi, Shafiya I.], [Godara, Rajesh], [Sudan, Vikrant], [Chakraborty, D.], [Katoch, Rajesh]']",['10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],[''],"['Epidemiology, haematology and molecular characterization of haemoprotozoon and rickettsial organisms causing infections in cattle of Jammu region, North India']"

"['Introduction Anaplasma sp. is an obligatory intracellular Gram-negative tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are the drugs of choice for treating domestic animals with acute anaplasmosis. Lack of documented information about oxytetracycline resistance in Anaplasma species in the world was the scope of this study to screen by PCR for the detection of the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in Anaplasma species from infected cattle and sheep in the Northwest and Southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods Total of 100 cattle and sheep blood samples collected from 2 provinces in the Northwest and 1 province in the Southwest of Iran were tested microscopically by the Giemsa staining examination and confirmed by PCR. Then the presence of two different oxytetracycline-resistance genes ( otrA, and otrB ) was detected by PCR in positive samples. Results The results showed that 60% of Anaplasma -infected samples were identified to have an otrA -resistance gene, and 26.67% had an otrB -resistance gene. The coexistence of two oxytetracycline-resistance determinants was encountered in 13.33% of the isolates. The significant difference in the frequency of otr genes was found among three Anaplasma species ( A. marginale , A. centrale and A. ovis ), and among three studied regions in Iran ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The identified sequences were submitted to the GenBank and deposited under accession numbers MN880729 and MN895439 for otrB and otrA genes.

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']
"['Ticks will diminish productivity among farm animals and transmit zoonotic diseases. We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%). Among all ticks, 32 (11%) were positive for Rickettsia spp. and 15 (5.2%) of these were identified as R. africae comprising at least two genetic clades, occurring in A. variegatum (n\u2009=\u200910) and A. cohaerens (n\u2009=\u20095).

The authors suspect that because the zoo differs in its sanitary and veterinary conditions from those found in nature, the results obtained here may differ markedly from those existing in the natural environment. Although we cannot be certain at this stage that the mites did not carry other pathogens in addition to those that were detectable by the primers that were used, the erythematous reaction to bite marks likely reflects a response to secretions of the mites rather than to transmitted pathogens.']","['Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta, [Gwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],[''],"['Do ectoparasites of the slow loris Nycticebus pygmaeus, pose a danger to humans?']"
"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis.

"['Background Various tick-borne infections like borreliosis and rickettsiosis pose a health risk to humans in many parts of the world. We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. Methods Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. Results Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. Conclusions Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti- Borrelia -antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years. Rickettsiosis is of limited concern in Denmark.

The aim of this study is to screen the important tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) carried by hard ticks in Inner Mongolia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and to estimate the risk of human infection imposed by tick bites. Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level. Individual tick DNA samples were detected by genus--specific or group-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these TBPs and combined with DNA sequencing assay to confirm the results of mNGS. Results R. raoultii (45.32%, 92/203), Candidatus R. tarasevichiae (5.42%, 11/203), Anaplasma sp.

"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals. Conclusions Most of the studied pathogenic agents are present in the prospected area, indicating a possible risk for both human and animal health.

"['Background Canine babesiosis and anaplasmosis, caused by Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , respectively, are significant tick-borne diseases in Baltic countries. Both diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of clinicopathological findings, by direct pathogen detection in blood smears or by indirect pathogen detection; however, because of high selectivity and specificity, molecular methods may be advantageous. The goal of this study was to develop a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase, (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and serum protein profiles in dogs affected with naturally acquired ehrlichiosis. Methods The animal materials had been consisted of ten dogs naturally infected with Ehrlichia canis , and ten controls negative for Ehrlichia canis . TAC, MDA, NO, SOD, GSH-Px, ADA activity and TP, ALB, GLOB levels were measured in sera of the animals. The serum protein concentrations were measured by autoanalyzer. The electrophoretic profiles of serum total protein were determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native-PAGE). Results In dogs with ehrlichiosis, decreased TAC ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GSH-Px ( P \u2009>\u20090.05) levels were determined. However, NO ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), SOD ( P \u2009<\u20090.05), ADA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), MDA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), TP ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GLO ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) levels were found as increased in the Ehrlichia positive dogs.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites and transmit various types of protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases in a wild as well as domestic animals and humans globally. Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

"['The aim of this study is to make aware every one of the deadliest diseases named severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). It has become the worldwide pandemic in recent few years. It is a kind of haemorrhagic fever, caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus of family Bunyaviridae. This syndrome is also a tick-borne zoonosis that means the virus transmitted from tick bite (having virus) into human body, i.e. infection spread from animals to humans and also transmitted from human to human. Epidemiological data of SFTS was collected to know the nature/symptoms of SFTSV. First case of this disease has been reported in China, followed by Japan, South korea, Taiwan, USA and many other countries. Vertebrates are the host of this disease and tick functions as a vector, where the virus can undergo brisk changes using gene mutation, homologous recombination and reassortments. The major symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Sometimes in very severe cases, full body organ failure may also take place and average death rate in humans is nearly 10\u2009%. Old aged peoples are more prone to SFTSV infection. Apart from the fact of increasing SFTSV related health problems to humans, the pathogenesis of SFTS virus in human is not entirely understood and no treatment to this virus is still available. The simplest way to protect our self from this infection is to refrain from tick bite. Therefore, this disease has evolved to produce serious health issues to humans in various countries of world including china.

"['Background Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a serious threat to humans, wildlife and livestock, and cause severe economic losses in many tropical drylands. The effective control of TBDs has been constrained by limited understanding of what determines tick loads in animals. We tested interactive effects of several biological factors (sex, age and body condition), one environmental factor (rainfall) and one human factor (management type) on tick loads in animals. Methods We collected ticks on animals at four sampling sites in the semi-arid savanna area of Laikipia County, Kenya, of which two are commercial ranches and the other two are open pastoral grazing areas. From 2017 to 2019, we collected a total of 2038 ticks from 619 domestic animals from various cattle and camel herds and from 79 tranquilised wild animals. Results Generally, wild herbivores (zebras, rhinos and elephants) had higher tick loads than domestic animals. As 83% of the tick samples were taken from Boran cattle, we analysed tick load in these cattle in more detail. Boran cattle had high tick loads in the wet season, especially those animals in poor condition. No differences were found between female and male cattle, regardless of season. The calves had high tick loads during both the wet and dry seasons, whereas the sub-adult and adult cattle had less ticks during the dry season. Cattle on the intensively managed ranches had lower tick load than those in the transhumant management system. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of establishing effective control of ticks on domestic animals in transhumant management systems as tick loads were high on these animals in both the wet and dry season.

Adult and larval tick DNA were amplified by PCR and later sequenced to identify mutations, if any, in the domain II S4-5 linker and domain III S6 regions in para voltage-gated sodium channel gene, at loci that were previously documented to be associated with deltamethrin resistance. Allele-specific PCR was performed for the amplification of target gene locus (C190A and T2134C) to genotype 1000 larvae each, at these loci. Genotype frequency was statistically analysed by Chi-square test. Results Bioassay using LPT revealed that LC 50 and LC 95 values of all the R. (B.) microplus isolates in this study were more than double the reported values of reference susceptible strain. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons of domain II S4-5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene revealed C190A mutation, A271G mutation as well as A–G mutation at 217th position. AS-PCR done to genotype C190A mutations revealed a frequency of 6%, 15% and 64%, respectively for homozygous-susceptible (SS), heterozygous (RS) and homozygous-resistant (RR) genotypes. In domain III S6 region of the gene, C2121T and A2102T mutations were observed. AS-PCR to genotype the previously reported T2134C mutation revealed 100% SS genotype in R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala. Conclusions Genotyping of R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala for target site mutations reportedly associated with deltamethrin resistance revealed a significantly high frequency of resistant genotypes at II S4–5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene. This study forms the first report of such mutations in Kerala, south India and demands serious attention in the light of increased prevalence of tick-borne haemoparasitic infection.']","['Amrutha, Anand, [Bindu, Lakshmanan], [Siju, J.], [Aravindakshan, T.

"['A survey to determine the prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) and ticks infesting cattle was conducted in the communal areas of the north-eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province (ECP) between January 2019 and October 2019. Tick counts, packed cell volume (PCV), body condition scores (BCS), and serological test for TBDs were seasonally conducted in communally grazed cattle ( n = 240) in Joe Gqabi district in two local municipalities (Elundini and Senqu). A standard indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used to determine antibodies to Babesia bigemina , Babesia bovis , and Ehrlichia ruminantium and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for antibodies to Anaplasma marginale detection. The highest tick loads were observed on cattle during the hot-wet and post-rainy seasons and lowest during the cool-dry season. The E. ruminantium prevalence in Elundini was 16% and 14% in post-rainy and hot-dry seasons respectively and 15% at Senqu during the post-rainy season. B. bigemina prevalence was highest at Elundini (18%) and Senqu (16%) during the post-rainy season and hot-wet season respectively. Cattle BCS was negatively correlated with E. ruminantium ( P < 0.01; r = − 0.203), B. bovis ( P < 0.01; r = − 0.125), and A. marginale ( P < 0.01; r = − 0.122) seroprevalence. The PCV was negatively correlated with B. bigemina ( P < 0.01; r = − 0.138) seroprevalence. On the other hand, E. ruminantium was positively correlated with Amblyomma hebraeum ( P < 0.05; r = 0.112) infestation, while B. bovis ( P < 0.05; r = 0.134) and B. bigemina ( P < 0.05; r = 0.188) were positively correlated with Rhipicephalus microplus infestation, and B. bigemina ( P < 0.05; r = 0.077) was positively correlated with Rhipicephalus decoloratus infestation. Our study reports for the first time the presence of R. microplus in the study area. Further research is, however, needed to better understand seroprevalence and the transmission mode of TBDs to cattle so that effective disease control measures can be developed.']","['Yawa, Mandla, [Nyangiwe, Nkululeko], [Jaja, Ishmael Festus], [Kadzere, Charles T.], [Marufu, Munyaradzi Christopher]']",['10.1007/s00436-020-07024-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-07024-4'],[''],['Prevalence of serum antibodies of tick-borne diseases and the presence of Rhipicephalus microplus in communal grazing cattle in the north-eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa']
"['Peri-domestic areas constitute an important source of tick exposure and tick-borne diseases (TBD). Nonetheless, the association between distal TBD risk factors (i.e. cognitive-/affective-risk perceptions, knowledge of the effectiveness of personal protective behaviors) and proximal TBD risk (i.e. tick activity and TBD diagnosis), among adult residents of private residential properties (PRP) is unknown.\xa0Data was collected from 299 PRP in south and central Indiana. We used Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests to identify differences in proximal and distal outcome measures.\xa0We found evidence of ‘ tick activity ’ at thirty-nine percent of PRP (n\xa0=\xa0116). Thirteen-percent of respondents (n\xa0=\xa040) self-reported a TBD diagnosis within their household. We found no significant association between ‘ self-reported TBD diagnosis within a household ’ and ‘ tick activity in the peri-domestic area. ’ Mean scores on ‘ affective tick & TBD risk assessment ’ were significantly higher among respondents when ‘tick activity’ was present in the peri-domestic area (median\xa0=\xa02, M\xa0=\xa02.54, p \xa0<\xa00.001). Similarly, respondents who ‘ self-reported TBD diagnosis within their household ’ had significantly higher mean scores on ‘ affective tick & TBD risk assessment ’ (median\xa0=\xa03, M\xa0=\xa03.30) than those who did not (median\xa0=\xa01, M\xa0=\xa01.93), ( U \xa0=\xa02750, p \xa0<\xa00.001). The proportion of peri-domestic areas with ‘tick activity’ was significantly higher if the primary respondent was male or an older adult respectively, compared to females and younger adults.\xa0Occupational/recreation-based settings may be more important pathways of tick exposure than peri-domestic settings in Indiana. Beyond education, it is important to consider the feelings and emotions that are elicited when at-risk populations consider their peri-domestic tick exposure and TBD risk, and where necessary design interventions to address those affective assessments.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Anderson, Kristina]']",['10.1007/s10900-020-00902-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00902-z'],[''],"['Relationship Between Tick Activity, Tick-Borne Diseases, Cognitive and Affective Risk Assessment in Peri-domestic Areas']"

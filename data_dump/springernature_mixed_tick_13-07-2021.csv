He also recommends a policy to adopt mobile phones for use as both the technology solution and access devices solution, and adds that renewable energy solutions, particularly solar energy, must be advanced to ensure availability of electricity for all residents, a necessity for education and skill development.']","['Sebusang, S.']",['10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],[''],['Cloud-Based Solutions for Education and Skill Development – Botswana']
"['Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can enhance understanding of global biodiversity by making it possible to study taxonomic groups that are difficult to sample. However, experimental choices made when generating eDNA data can impact biodiversity surveys and must be carefully considered during study design. Here, we explored the impact of DNA extraction protocol and metabarcode choice on recovery of meiofauna DNA from sand. We extracted DNA from untreated sand and from sand treated with either Ludox or MgCl 2 and amplified DNA using the 18S and CO1 metabarcodes. We found differences in species composition and richness both between metabarcodes and among sampling strategies, confirming the sensitivity of the experiments to both parameters. Combining data from multiple barcodes and from multiple extraction protocols increased recovered meiofaunal taxonomic diversity. Future metabarcoding studies and meta-analyses should consider the effects of sampling protocols on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the need to continue to improve existing reference databases of morphological and molecular characterization of meiofauna, in particular of the tropics, which are poorly represented in existing databases.']","['Castro, Lyda R., [Meyer, Rachel S.], [Shapiro, Beth], [Shirazi, Sabrina], [Cutler, Samuel], [Lagos, Ana M.], [Quiroga, Sigmer Y.]']",['10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],[''],['Metabarcoding meiofauna biodiversity assessment in four beaches of Northern Colombia: effects of sampling protocols and primer choice']
"['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great attentions over the past few decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Crystallization is sought in many application fields since it allows enhancing or even promoting properties of catalysis, energy storage and photoelectric properties. However, the crystallization process of nanostructured COFs remains to be challenging. Synthetic approaches to establish nucleation and elongation growth of COFs for controlling crystallization have drawn substantial amount of attentions. Nanostructured COFs have exhibited significant advantages when applied in (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices as well. In this review, recent progress in precisely design strategy of fabricating various nanostructured COFs and their applications as (electro)photocatalyzer and energy storage devices are summarized. After a brief introduction of the design principles, composition and interior architecture, the morphology of nanostructured COFs including porous and mesoporous stacked-layer structure, nanosheet structure, nanorod structure, ordered stripe arrays and various nanocomposites are thoroughly described. Reactions dedicated to crystallization process for two-dimensional (2D) COFs are discussed further. Then, the applications of nanostructured COFs as (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges for the synthetic technology of nanostructured COFs materials are particularly discussed. Personal insights into the challenges and opportunities on pursuing topologies as hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk–shell structures were raised to broaden the applications.']","['Chen, Haoyun, [Yuan, Xingzhong], [Wang, Hou], [Yu, Hanbo], [Jiang, Longbo]']",['10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],[''],['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks with elevated crystallization for (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices']
"['According to modern classification, tick-borne flaviviruses have been divided into a mammalian tick-borne virus group and a seabird tick-borne virus group (STBVG). The STBVG includes the Tyuleniy virus, Meaban virus, Saumarez Reef virus, and the recently discovered Kama virus (KAMV). The latter was isolated from Ixodes lividus , an obligate parasitic tick of the sand martin ( Riparia riparia ), in 1989 in the central part of the Russian Plain. In 2014, based on molecular genetic analysis, it was shown that KAMV is a new virus belonging to STBVG, genus Flavivirus , fam. Flaviviridae . Very little is known about the Kama virus concerning its range, vectors, and reservoir hosts. GenBank contains a single sequence of the complete genome of this virus. In the present study, the complete genome sequences of two strains, isolated in 1983 in the Omsk region (Western Siberia) from gamasid mites in the nests of rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ), have been determined. Phylogenetic analyses of their genomes showed a close relationship both with each other (approx. 98.9% nucleotide identity) and with KAMV isolated in European Russia (approx. 98.4% nucleotide identity). The ecological features of KAMV that are due to the species of the vector (gamasid mites) and its hosts (colonial birds of the mainland of Eurasia) indicate that KAMV is an atypical representative STBVG.']","['Kovalev, S.

Our analysis is based on administrative county-level data on vaccination purchases linked to indicators of media coverage of the meningococcal disease and to administrative records of disease incidence.

"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 117:32493, 2020a), where we reported that BCP/BCPO (beta-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide) in fresh horse manure is sufficient to drive manure rolling behavior (HMR) in giant panda and attenuate the cold sensitivity of mice by directly targeting and inhibiting transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an archetypical cold-activated ion channel of mammals. The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']
"['Probability of informed trading (PIN) models characterize trading with certain types of information through a tree structure. Different tree structures with different numbers of groups for market participants have been proposed, with no clear, consistent tree used in the literature. One of the main causes of this inconsistency is that these trees are artificially proposed through a bottom-up approach rather than implied by actual market data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that infers a tree structure directly from empirical data. More precisely, we use hierarchical clustering to construct a tree for each individual firm and then infer an aggregate tree through a voting mechanism. We test this method on US data from January 2002 for 7608 companies, which results in a tree with two layers and four groups. The characteristics of the resulting aggregate tree are between those of several proposed tree structures in the literature, demonstrating that these proposed trees all reflect only part of the market, and one should consider the proposed empirically driven method when seeking a tree representing the whole market.']","['Lin, Emily, [Kao, Chu-Lan Michael], [Adityarini, Natasha Sonia]']",['10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],[''],['Data-driven tree structure for PIN models']
"['The aim of this study was to explore the associations between temperamental reactivity and regulation and the emergence of anxiety traits in a longitudinal sample of infants enriched for later ASD. Parents of 143 infants who were at high- and low-risk for ASD rated their child’s temperament traits when they were 9, 15 and 24\xa0months old; they rated anxiety and ASD traits when they were 36\xa0months old. The findings suggest that behavioural inhibition may be an early predictor of later anxiety in children with and without ASD and that lower levels of effortful control in children who later develop ASD may contribute to the higher expression of anxiety within this population.']","['Ersoy, Mutluhan, [Charman, Tony], [Pasco, Greg], [Carr, Ewan], [Johnson, Mark H.], [Jones, Emily J.

"['Mating with the wrong species is surprisingly common in nature. Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

"['Free-ranging giant pandas ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) in China recently were reported to rub and roll in horse manure, a behavior that was observed frequently at low ambient temperatures.

Mice\xa0and rats treated with BCP/BCPO exhibited enhanced cold tolerance in behavioral assays, and BCP/BCPO inhibited cold-activated ion channels of mammals expressed in human kidney cells; these laboratory results were cited in support of the contention that giant pandas tolerate low ambient temperatures by applying horse manure to their integument. The demonstrated biocidal activities of BCP and BCPO against insects and ticks, and the reported elicitation of anointing in giant pandas with materials other than horse manure, including substances or constituents thereof known to act as arthropod biocides, are consistent with an anti-consumer function of anointing by giant pandas.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions.

Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Purpose Women’s worry about developing breast cancer may influence their decision to use preventive therapy. However, the direction of this relationship has been questioned. We prospectively investigated the relationship between breast cancer worry and uptake of preventive therapy. The socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with high breast cancer worry were also investigated. Methods Women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited from clinics across England ( n \u2009=\u2009408). Participants completed a survey on their breast cancer worry, socio-demographic and clinical factors. Uptake of tamoxifen was recorded at 3\xa0months ( n \u2009=\u2009258 women, 63.2%). Both primary and sensitivity analyses were conducted using different classifications of low, medium and high worry. Results 39.5% of respondents reported medium breast cancer worry at baseline and 21.2% reported high worry. Ethnic minority women were more likely to report high worry than white women (OR\u2009=\u20093.02, 95%CI 1.02, 8.91, p \u2009=\u20090.046). Women educated below degree level were more likely to report high worry than those with higher education (OR\u2009=\u20092.29, 95%CI 1.28, 4.09, p \u2009=\u20090.005). No statistically significant association was observed between worry and uptake.

"['Aims CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes. It is currently unclear whether daily glucose variability contributes to CVD. Therefore, we investigated whether glucose variability is associated with arterial measures that are considered important in CVD pathogenesis. Methods We included participants of The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort, who underwent at least 48\xa0h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ( n \u2009=\u2009853; age: 59.9\u2009±\u20098.6\xa0years; 49% women, 23% type 2 diabetes). We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

This survey was created to illuminate which and how qMRI techniques are currently applied across Europe. Methods In total, 4753 neuroradiologists from 27 countries received an online questionnaire. Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85). QIBA and EIBALL were not well known (12.5%, n = 34, and 11.0%, n = 30). Conclusions The clinical implementation of qMRI methods is highly variable. Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']
"['Experimental closure of the surface energy balance during convective periods is a long-standing problem. With experimental data from the Idealized horizontal Planar Array experiment for Quantifying Surface heterogeneity, the terms of the temperature-tendency equation are computed, with an emphasis on the total derivative. The experiment occurred at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test facility at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground during the summer of 2019. The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ).

A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings.

The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001).

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"
"['Under-detection of HIV/AIDS still burdens many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our randomized trial investigated the effects of financial incentives and a behavioral nudge to induce HIV testing and learning HIV status in Ecuador. In the control group, 12.2% of participants agreed to testing, and 5.3% learned results. A financial incentive paid at testing increased the fraction of participants tested by 50.1 percentage points (95% CI 38.8 to 61.4) and the fraction who learned their status by 8.9 percentage points (95% CI 5.3 to 12.5); the nudge had no effect. The HIV-positive rate was 1.2% in the control group, and incentives prompted a 4.7 percentage point (95% CI 0.5 to 8.9) higher proportion of HIV-positive detection. Incentives also induced earlier testing, suggesting reduced procrastination. This suggests that information with appropriately timed small financial incentives can improve HIV testing and detection of new cases in the general population in LMIC settings.']","['Macis, Mario, [Grunauer, Michelle], [Gutierrez, Erika], [Izurieta, Ricardo], [Phan, Phillip], [Reina Ortiz, Miguel], [Rosas, Carlos], [Teran, Enrique]']",['10.1007/s10461-021-03215-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03215-x'],[''],['Using Incentives and Nudging to Improve Non-Targeted HIV Testing in Ecuador: A Randomized Trial']

Three hundred sixty-two of CNVRs were significantly differentiated in both statistics and 313 genes were located on the population differentiated CNVRs. Conclusion For some of these genes, the averages of copy numbers were also different between populations and these may be candidate genes under selection.

"['The large integration of variable energy resources is expected to shift a large part of the energy exchanges closer to real-time, where more accurate forecasts are available. In this context, the short-term electricity markets and in particular the intraday market are considered a suitable trading floor for these exchanges to occur. A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']
"['Cellular identity in complex multicellular organisms is determined in part by the physical organization of cells. However, large-scale investigation of the cellular interactome remains technically challenging. Here we develop cell interaction by multiplet sequencing (CIM-seq), an unsupervised and high-throughput method to analyze direct physical cell–cell interactions between cell types present in a tissue. CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution into constituent cell types. CIM-seq estimates parameters such as number of cells and cell types in each multiplet directly from sequencing data, making it compatible with high-throughput droplet-based methods. When applied to gut epithelium or whole dissociated lung and spleen, CIM-seq correctly identifies known interactions, including those between different cell lineages and immune cells. In the colon, CIM-seq identifies a previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1 , which is directly adjacent to colonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that CIM-seq is broadly applicable to unsupervised profiling of cell-type interactions in different tissue types. CIM-seq offers an unsupervised deconvolution method to profile cell–cell interactions by sequencing cell multiplets of a given tissue, and was employed to analyze diverse tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, lung and spleen.']","['Andrews, Nathanael, [Serviss, Jason T.], [Geyer, Natalie], [Andersson, Agneta B.], [Dzwonkowska, Ewa], [Šutevski, Iva], [Heijboer, Rosan], [Baryawno, Ninib], [Gerling, Marco], [Enge, Martin]']",['10.1038/s41592-021-01196-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01196-2'],[''],['An unsupervised method for physical cell interaction profiling of complex tissues']

"['Tick-borne diseases are the most commonly reported vector-borne diseases in North America and recent estimates of Lyme disease prevalence in the United States alone are as high as 300,000 cases annually. While the vast majority of cases in the US are reported in the upper Midwest and northeast, there are cases reported from throughout California every year, yet research on ticks and the diseases they vector has been restricted primarily to a handful of northern California counties.\nRecent research has extended this work to Santa Barbara County and yielded results suggesting both that phenology of some tick species is remarkably constant over large geographic areas and that tick populations and communities can be highly variable even within relatively small geographic areas with similar habitats and climate. As a result, acaralogical risk is expected to be highly variable across the landscape.\nRecent large-scale studies and surveillance efforts have been undertaken in the eastern US to characterize this variability and identify areas of high expected acaralogical risk. This type of large-scale sampling effort on the ground is crucial to our understanding of the highly geographically variable nature of ticks and tick-borne diseases and what factors are driving their emergence.\nThis project aims to use the UC Natural Reserve System to carry out a standardized sampling and surveillance effort applied at a larger geographical scale than has yet been undertaken in California. The goal of which is both to begin to characterize regional differences in tick communities, infection prevalence, and human risk as well as provide baseline information for the UC Reserves, and for the safety of staff and researchers working on them, that can be built upon in future studies. Specifically, data collected from the reserves will be used to ask the following questions:\n1.\tHow do tick community composition and relative abundance differ regionally in California?\nH1: I. pacificus will make up a larger proportion of the community at higher latitudes and in cooler, wetter climates; the proportion will decrease as latitude decreases and as climate becomes hotter and drier where it will be dominated by Dermacentor spp.\nH2: Overall tick abundance will decrease with latitude and as climate becomes more arid.\n2.\tAre there differences in infection prevalence of I. pacificus with B. burgdorferi on a regional scale in California?\nH3: Infection prevalence will be highest in the north and decrease with latitude.']",['Andy MacDonald'],['nrs.874.3'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['tick-borne disease', 'Lyme disease', 'vector-borne diseases', 'acaralogical risk', 'regional differenes', 'tick communities', 'UC Reserves', 'Dermacentor spp.', 'I. pacificus', 'B. burgdorferi', 'Infection prevalence']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/nrs.874.3'],[''],"['Assessing regional differences in community composition, infection, prevalence, and human risk of tick-borne disease in California']"

"[""Brood tables, also called run reconstructions, utilize annual estimates of the total run (commercial catch plus escapement), and samples of ages, to estimate the number of recruits per age class. These data are useful for salmon biologists to understand salmon productivity and salmon life histories.

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: How does the golden-mantled ground squirrel contend with the severe restriction in time available for reproduction and growth? The answer may emerge from examination of the correlation between the length of the active season and other characteristics of the species. The snow-free season diminishes from low to high elevations. In response, the duration of the above-ground active season of the golden-mantled ground squirrel would be expected to decrease. The restriction of such a critical resource may have resulted in at least 2 sets of adaptive modifications.  1. The physiological control of the time of spring emergence and fall immergence in the annual cycle may have been adjusted to seasonal constraints. 2. Life history aspects, such as age of first reproduction, litter size, and survivorship, may have been altered by selection under different climatic regimes. The research reported here tested for the natural occurrence of these variations, whether they be genetically or merely phenotypically based. III. Within the subspecies Spermophilus lateralis chrysodeirus, (the researcher) tested for geographical and temporal variation in the schedule of springtime emergence, reproduction, and fall immergence. IV. This section describes variation in several demographic features of the golden-mantled ground squirrel, a hibernator, over a climatic gradient.']",['Michael Tyken Bronson'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.671.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek Basin', 'Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.671.1'],[''],['Altitudinal Variation in the Annual Cycle and Life History of the Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis)']

"['Although the geographic range is a fundamental unit of analysis for many macroecological and biogeographical studies, as a representation of the spatial distribution of individuals it is clearly a scale-dependent abstraction. As any amateur naturalist realizes, a species is not guaranteed to be present at every point within the range delimited by a field guide. Geographically extensive survey data such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) allow the characterization of distribution patterns within the geographic range. Using BBS data (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) paired with digital range maps from NatureServe (http://www.natureserve.org/getData/birdMaps.jsp), I calculated a simple measure of range occupancy for 298 species of North American birds.

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or escape the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in or near freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. This dataset contains salmon escapement data extracted from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's OceanAK database, and contains data from multiple regions in Alaska.""]",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1VT1QB1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],[['escapement']],['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1VT1QB1'],[''],"['Daily salmon escapement counts from the OceanAK database, Alaska, 1921-2017']"

"['Understanding species interactions and their effects on distributions is crucial for assessing the impacts of global change, particularly for invasive species. Co-occurrence models can help investigate these effects when interactions are likely given shared traits. For such an assemblage of invasive and native carnivorans, we examined how patterns of co-occurrence change across space and environmental gradients using a static multispecies occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detectability and models co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, and also extended it to be temporally dynamic. We focused on invasive raccoons, which pose threats to humans and wildlife globally. In Japan, raccoons prey on many native taxa, but little is known about interactions with sympatric carnivorans. We searched for signals of competitive exclusion of native raccoon dogs (tanuki) and invasive masked palm civets by applying the model to detection data from a broad-scale trapping effort over 6 years. Forest cover was the strongest predictor of occupancy for individual species and raccoon co-occurrences, and raccoon occupancy probability increased with forest cover conditionally depending on the co-occurring carnivoran: only tanuki absence or civet presence had positive responses. However, tanuki occupancy probability increased with forest cover despite any co-occurrence. Thus, we found no evidence of competitive exclusion by raccoons, contrary to our expectations. As parts of the world with invasive raccoons can also have invasive tanuki, our findings may have broad management implications. The model we present should be useful for inferring signals of biotic interactions between species with low detectability over multi-year time frames.']",['Jamie M.

For such an assemblage of invasive and native carnivorans, we examined how patterns of co-occurrence change across space and environmental gradients using a static multispecies occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detectability and models co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, and also extended it to be temporally dynamic. We focused on invasive raccoons, which pose threats to humans and wildlife globally. In Japan, raccoons prey on many native taxa, but little is known about interactions with sympatric carnivorans. We searched for signals of competitive exclusion of native raccoon dogs (tanuki) and invasive masked palm civets by applying the model to detection data from a broad-scale trapping effort over 6 years. Forest cover was the strongest predictor of occupancy for individual species and raccoon co-occurrences, and raccoon occupancy probability increased with forest cover conditionally depending on the co-occurring carnivoran: only tanuki absence or civet presence had positive responses. However, tanuki occupancy probability increased with forest cover despite any co-occurrence. Thus, we found no evidence of competitive exclusion by raccoons, contrary to our expectations. As parts of the world with invasive raccoons can also have invasive tanuki, our findings may have broad management implications. The model we present should be useful for inferring signals of biotic interactions between species with low detectability over multi-year time frames.']",['Jamie M.

"['Human activities often lead natural systems to be nutrient enriched, with anthropogenically derived nutrients commonly delivered in discrete pulses.  Both nutrient enrichment and nutrient pulses can impact plant performance and phenotypic plasticity, especially in invasive species, but quantifying their independent effects remains challenging. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment and nutrient pulse magnitude, we established a common garden experiment using the North American wetland invader Phragmites australis and its native conspecific Phragmites australis subsp. americanus (five source populations each). We exposed plants to three levels of nutrient enrichment that were delivered either in small or large magnitude pulses, examining productivity and plasticity responses over a single growing season. Productivity and biomass allocation differed by lineage, with invasive Phragmites producing 73% more biomass and 66% more culms, but with the native growing 31% taller and allocating more of its biomass belowground.  Contrary to expectations, both lineages responded similarly to nutrient enrichment and were similarly plastic in their traits.  Nutrient enrichment, rather than nutrient pulses, led to large productivity gains and trait plasticity magnitudes.  However, total biomass and leaf-level traits (specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration) were responsive to variation in nutrient pulse magnitudes. By decoupling the effects of nutrient enrichment from nutrient pulses, our study demonstrates the independent effects of these two key factors for plant performance and, by extension, invasion success.  We report trait-based similarities between two lineages of Phragmites that play contrasting ecological roles in North American wetlands, and we highlight the potentially detrimental effects of nutrient pulses.

"['The management of North American waterfowl is predicated on long-term, continental scale banding implemented prior to the hunting season (i.e., Julyâ\x80\x93September) and subsequent reporting of bands recovered by hunters. However, single-season banding and encounter operations have a number of characteristics that limit their application to estimating demographic rates and evaluating hypothesized limiting factors throughout the annual cycle. We designed and implemented a 2-season banding program for American black ducks, mallards, and hybrids in eastern North America to evaluate potential application to annual life cycle conservation and sport harvest management. We assessed model fit and compared estimates of annual survival among model types (i.e., 2-season and single season by banding season) to evaluate model assumptions and potential application to population modeling and management. Estimates of annual survival and patterns among age and sex cohorts using pre-season and 2-season models were similar to previously published results. We found patterns of seasonal survival varied by species, age, and to a lesser extent, sex. Our results suggest the 2-season model generally fits well with the most consistent lack of fit being due to black ducks in the post-season banded cohort. There was generally high agreement between annual survival estimates from the 2-season model and pre- and post-season data only model. Hunter recovered birds exhibited similar spatial distributions regardless of banding season suggested both banded samples were from the same population, though the Goodness-of-Fit test suggests this assumption was violated in some regions and years. We conclude the estimates of seasonal and annual survival for black ducks and mallards based on the 2-season banding program are valid and accurate based on model fit statistics, similarity in survival estimates across models, and similarities in the distribution of recoveries. The 2-season program provides greater precision and insight into the survival process and will improve the ability of researchers and managers to test competing hypotheses regarding population regulation resulting in more effective management.']",['Patrick Devers'],['urn:uuid:562c0b69-2d8a-4975-a719-18ce16d473f4'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['banding, black duck, encounter, mallard, survival2']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/urn%3Auuid%3A562c0b69-2d8a-4975-a719-18ce16d473f4'],[''],['Evaluation of a 2-season banding program to estimate seasonal and annual survival probabilities of migratory birds: a case study of American black ducks and eastern mallards.']

I. Study site and methods are described. II. Population structural differences are found between chipmunk populations in the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada. Litter size variation between species, and age specific fecundity of females within and between years are shown. Life table analyses are performed and life history and reproductive parameters are then compared to those of other chipmunk spc. Latitudinal trends are also analyzed. III. Ontogenetic and annual cyclic changes in reproductive state and weight will be analyzed for both sexes. The reproductive seasonal phenology of Eutamia sonomae will be compared to those of other species of Eutamias. Male reproductive strategies in Eutamias are proposed and the environmental and evolutionary regimes that have selected for these are discussed. Eutamias is then compared in its mating social system with other N.

"['The Broodstock Development and Genetics Group embraces a diversity of research projects on the population, evolutionary and aquacultural genetics of marine invertebrates. Principal activity funded by the      California Sea Grant Program is devoted to controlling the reproductive cycle of lobsters so that a large scale selective breeding program can develop in step with the commercial cultivation of this species.      A major breakthrough in this effort has been the discovery that ovarian development and egg extrusion are synchronized in groups of lobster females experiencing a transition from short day to long day photoperiods. Moreover, the conditions for and extent of mutual interference between growth and reproductive processes are now being documented. Since growth rate can be regulated by temperature and ovarian maturation by photoperiod, the implication of this research is clearly that it will be possible to control the entire life cycle of lobsters in captivity and manipulate reproductive cycles to yield seed for lobster farms on a year-round basis. Current research is aimed at better understanding the critical durations      of certain photoperiod-temperature regimes needed to complete the lengthy reproductive cycle of Homarus.      The European lobster (H. gammarus) frequently spawns annually in the laboratory, but most American lobsters (H. americanus) require about l8-20 months. Some exceptional annual spawnings by American lobsters have occurred, however, and we are hopeful of routinely shortening the cycle by photoperiod-temperature manipulation.      In the meantime hybridizations between the European and American species of lobsters continue to bear fruit. We are anxious to test the fertility of the hybrids as the next step in assessing what intrinsic reproductive incompatibility, if any, separates the two described species of Homarus. Many of these Fl hybrids are approaching maturity, have received broodstock ID numbers, and several have been mated. One Fl female matured earlier this year, was mated to an Fl hybrid male and extruded a complement of F2 hybrid embryos. These eggs were unfortunately lost, a problem also encountered with other broodstock: research on the causes of egg loss, including the role of diet, has begun.      Chemically mediated growth inhibition among juvenile lobsters has been discovered. An experiment has recently been completed on this growth inhibition as a function of flow rate through a linear array of compartments: the results should help discriminate between two alternatives, that the inhibitor is continuously produced or that it is intermittently secreted or excreted perhaps as a component of urine.      Other studies on the species specifically of the inhibition and the role of body size differences are      planned or in progress.      An electrophoretic study of abalone was completed for Sea Grant to assess the extent of genetic differences among isolated populations in view of planned hatchery release programs. Several protein      polymorphisms were found, but the frequencies of alleles did not differ dramatically among Channel Island and mainland localities.      A three-year study of genetic divergence among oysters of the Crassostrea virginica group was initiated with NSF support. A field trip in Mexico last March allowed collection of live oysters from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coasts. Electrophoretic analyses are currently being made.      A comprehensive review of all aspects of the genetics of crustaceans was completed for Academic PressÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99 forthcoming Biology of the Crustacea, Vol. l.

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or 'escape' the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. Some data about non-salmon species are also included. This dataset contains compiled data from a number of sources. The .Rmd merges all datasets, identifies and flags duplicate records, and performs quality assurance checks by filtering and graphing results.

"['Alaska encompasses several climate types because of its vast size, high-latitude location, proximity to oceans, and complex topography. There is a great need to understand how climate varies regionally for climatic research and forecasting applications. Although climate-type zones have been established for Alaska on the basis of sea- sonal climatological mean behavior, there has been little attempt to construct climate divisions that identify regions with consistently homogeneous climatic variability. In this study, cluster analysis was applied to monthly-average temperature data from 1977 to 2010 at a robust set of weather stations to develop climate divisions for the state. Mean-adjusted Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer surface temperature estimates were employed to fill in missing temperature data when possible. Thirteen climate divisions were identified on the basis of the cluster analysis and were subsequently refined using local expert knowledge. Divisional boundary lines were drawn that encompass the grouped stations by following major surrounding topographic boundaries. Correlation analysis between station and gridded downscaled temperature and precipitation data supported the division placement and boundaries. The new divisions north of the Alaska Range were the North Slope, West Coast, Central Interior, Northeast Interior, and Northwest Interior. Divisions south of the Alaska Range were Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Aleutians, Northeast Gulf, Northwest Gulf, North Panhandle, Central Panhandle, and South Panhandle. Correlations with various Pacific Ocean and Arctic climatic teleconnection indices showed numerous significant relationships between seasonal division average temperature and the Arctic Oscillation, Pacificâ\x80\x93North American pattern, North Pacific index, and Pacific decadal oscillation.']",[''],['dcx_fa0cd520-c553-4ff9-90f9-cfe3d0176d7e_0'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['climate dividions', 'climate variability', 'Alaska']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/dcx_fa0cd520-c553-4ff9-90f9-cfe3d0176d7e_0'],[''],['Climate Divisions for Alaska Based on Objective Methods']
"['The contribution of small Canadian Arctic rivers to the total freshwater flux through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is unknown and remains a significant gap in the growing data set addressing the freshwater budget of the Arctic and subarctic oceans. Limited geochemical data have been collected from the CAA, Nares Strait, and Baffin Bay, and the existing data sets are too sparse to differentiate among the various freshwater sources thought to contribute to the total freshwater pool (i.e., Pacific water, sea-ice meltwater, and meteoric water derived from the Mackenzie River, Eurasian rivers, and local runoff). New programs have begun to collect requisite geochemical data in Davis Strait and other regions. However, interpretation of these measurements may be biased by typical endmember assignments associated with Eurasian and North American river runoff. Characterizing the geochemical signature of local freshwater inputs is essential for distinguishing these contributions from those of Arctic Ocean origin, but virtually no studies have sampled small Arctic rivers discharging into the CAA. Available data collected from Baffin Bay and Hudson Strait suggest local rivers do not resemble the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers typically assumed to represent North American runoff. While the annual discharge of any given river is relatively small, the combined discharge of all rivers is sufficient to support nearshore, narrow boundary currents, which provide an important, but often neglected, transport mechanism. Thus, local contributions of freshwater may impact the total volume flux and geochemistry of the Canadian Arctic throughflow that has historically been attributed entirely to export from the Arctic Ocean. The project consists of a three-year study to characterize the total alkalinity, barium, DOC, major ion and isotope (Î´18O, 87Sr/86Sr) geochemistry of remote CAA rivers and estuaries with the ultimate aim of resolving the contribution of local freshwater inputs to CAA boundary currents. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but emphasize the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The study focuses on eight rivers: the Coppermine, Ellice, Back, Hayes, Kuujuua, Thomsen, Cunningham, and Clyde Rivers. During summer field seasons of 2014-2016, four researchers are transported to each site via Twin Otter aircraft. Field operations begin at Kugluktuk (Coppermine River) in early July 2014 (river sampling only) and in early August of 2015 and 2016 (river and estuary sampling). Researchers spend 3-5 days at each site. The team utilizes airports located at Kugluktuk, Clyde River, and Ulukhaktok. More remote sites near the Thomsen, Ellice, Cunningham, and Back Rivers are accessed via equipping the Twin Otter with tundra tires. River water samples are collected by wading into the river and using an extendable pole to collect bulk (1L) samples from the central current. Bulk samples are then immediately filtered using a peristaltic pump and small subsamples are collected. Weekly samples are also collected by local workers in the more populated regions surrounding the Coppermine and Clyde Rivers to gain insight into the changes in river chemistry over the course of the spring and summer flow periods. Samples are collected from estuaries adjoining the river mouths from small, inflatable boats and a peristaltic pump equipped with multiple lengths of C-FLEX tubing.']",['Matthew Alkire'],['doi:10.18739/A2CP8H'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN CHEMISTRY > MARINE GEOCHEMISTRY', 'EARTH SCIENCE > CLIMATE INDICATORS > ATMOSPHERIC/OCEAN INDICATORS > FRESH WATER RIVER DISCHARGE', 'EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN CIRCULATION > FRESH WATER FLUX', 'EARTH SCIENCE > TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE > SURFACE WATER > RIVERS/STREAMS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > CHEMICAL METERS/ANALYZERS > PH METERS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > CONDUCTIVITY SENSORS > CONDUCTIVITY METERS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > SAMPLERS > BOTTLES/FLASKS/JARS > WATER BOTTLES', 'AIRCRAFT', 'STATION', 'POINT', 'MONTHLY TO ANNUAL', 'inlandWaters', 'oceans']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2CP8H'],[''],['Small Canadian Arctic River Flows']

"[""The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data packages includes data collected as part of Dale Wrubleski's PhD, as part of the invertebrates section of MERP.\n\tThis study examined chironomid responses to the flooding of ten drained experimental marshes in Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. Emergence traps were used to monitor chironomid emergence from three vegetation types (Symphyotrichum ciliatum, Scolochloa festucacea, and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) flooded at two water depths (shallow: 20-40 cm, deep: 50-70 cm) over a four-year period. Note that Dale Wrubleski's chironomid files are directly connected to the regular emergence trap sampling as part of the long-term monitoring program for invertebrates for MERP (stored in a separate data package on the KNB), and these counts are not independant of chironomid counts for the long-term sampling. This file only provides further classification of chironomid family/subfamily counts  to species level, in addition to total biomass for each species, in a subsample of the cover types and sample sites monitored for the long-term invertebrate monitoring program.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in westward and southeast Kodiak. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data file (ASL DATA EXPORT.csv), a reformatting script that reformats the original data file into a consistent format (ASL_Formatting_SoutheastKodiak.R), and the reformatted dataset as a .csv file (ASL_formatted_SoutheastKodiak.csv).']",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1SJ1HWB'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['age, sex, length']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1SJ1HWB'],[''],"['Salmon age, sex, and length data from Westward and Southeast Alaska, 1979-2017']"

"['NCEAS-1998-2244-NonDist-Dataset: The NCEAS Community\n        Dynamics Working Group brought together theoretical and\n        empirical ecologists to evaluate the relative importance of\n        intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability in natural\n        communities. We focused on zooplankton community dynamics, in\n        part because we had access to extensive time series data on\n        zooplankton community structure from 35 North American lakes.\n        Thirty-four of the lakes were concentrated at 5 sites: the North\n        Temperate Lakes LTER site in Wisconsin; the University of Notre\n        Dame Environmental Research Center in Michigan; the Dorset\n        Environmental Research Centre, the Experimental Lakes Area, and\n        the Sudbury region, all in Ontario. We also have data for saline\n        Mono Lake in California. Our database has many strengths,\n        including the length of the time series (5-21 years); consistent\n        sampling methodologies, particularly for zooplankton; and the\n        availability of information on environmental factors, including\n        phytoplankton, physical parameters, and water chemistry. Another\n        unique aspect of our dataset is that it includes data from both\n        undisturbed reference lakes and experimentally manipulated\n        lakes. The whole-lake experiments include food web\n        manipulations, nutrient enrichments, acidifications and limings,\n        and an unplanned invasion of an exotic species. Some of the\n        experimental manipulations are even replicated within and among\n        sites, providing a unique opportunity to explore the extent to\n        which responses to a particular perturbation are consistent\n        across lakes. In addition to determining how manipulations\n        change the dynamics of zooplankton communities, we are using the\n        data from the reference lakes to establish bounds on normal ranges of variability and to explore how this variability differs among lakes at a site vs. between sites. Thus, our joint database is facilitating extensive comparisons of zooplankton community dynamics at the scale of whole lakes.']",['Anthony Ives'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nceas.19.9'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['North America', 'limnology', 'lakes', 'zooplankton', 'time series data']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnceas.19.9'],[''],"['Insights on community dynamics from large-scale, long-term      data: time series for zooplankton and environmental variates from      35 North American lakes']"
"['Many parasites and parasitoids are able to manipulate the behavior of their hosts for their own benefit. Parasites are also known to select their hosts based on certain physical characteristics, such as body size, that optimize their own fitness. Conopid fly larvae (Conopidae: Diptera) are endoparasitoids of bumblebees in Europe and North America. Previous research on the interaction between conopid flies and a single European bumblebee host species, Bombus terrestris, demonstrated that bees infected with a conopid larva would bury themselves in soil just prior to death, and that this behavior may confer fitness benefits on the conopid developing within the bee.  Additionally, it has been shown in several studies out of Europe and Canada that conopids are found more frequently in bees that are larger-bodied, a host characteristic that correlates positively with at least two measures of fitness: conopid pupal weight and adult fly emergence. This study, which took place at Blandy Experimental Farm in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, found that three locally common bumblebee species (B. bimaulatus, B. griseocollis, and B. impatiens) exhibit a digging behavior in response to parasitism by conopid larvae. Unexpectedly, one species, B. griseocollis, experienced a significantly lower rate of detected parasitism than the other two species.  I hypothesize that this may be due to reduced survivorship of larva within this host species. In accordance with previous research, this study also found that the likelihood of being parasitized increased with host body size, and that larger conopid pupae developed in larger-bodied bees. The findings of this research are novel: this study documents a parasite-induced modification of bumble bee behavior previously not observed in North American bumblebees and identifies one host species that may possess an ability to resist developing parasites. Further, this study sheds additional light on conopid-bumblebee host selection dynamics.']",['Staige Davis'],['Blandy.25.2'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Conopid', 'Parasitism', 'Digging Behavior', 'Behavior Manipulation', 'Bombus', 'Shenandoah Valley']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/Blandy.25.2'],[''],"['Bumble Bees and Parasitoid Flies: Manipulation of Host Behavior and the Importance of Host Body Size, Blandy Experimental Farm, Boyce, VA, 2012']"

"['In the ALE/GAGE/AGAGE global network program, continuous high frequency gas chromatographic measurements of four biogenic/anthropogenic gases (methane, CH4; nitrous oxide, N2O; hydrogen, H2; and carbon monoxide, CO) and several anthropogenic gases that contribute to stratospheric ozone destruction and/or to the greenhouse effect have been carried out at five globally distributed sites for several years. The program, which began in 1978, is divided into three parts associated with three changes in instrumentation: the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE), which used Hewlett Packard HP5840 gas chromatographs; the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE), which used HP5880 gas chromatographs; and the present Advanced GAGE (AGAGE). AGAGE uses two types of instruments: a gas chromatograph with multiple detectors (GC-MD), and a gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric analysis (GC-MS). Beginning in January 2004, an improved cryogenic preconcentration system (Medusa) replaced the absorption-desorption module in the GC-MS systems at Mace Head and Cape Grim; this provided improved capability to measure a broader range of volatile perfluorocarbons with high global warming potentials. The Medusa GC-MS systems were subsequently used at other AGAGE stations (Trinidad Head, Barbados, American Samoa, Zeppelin, Jungfraujoch, and Goan) after the initial setup at Mace Head and Cape Grim.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes artificial substrate data, collected as part of the invertebrate section of MERP.\n\tInvertebrate monitoring during the Marsh Ecology Research Project (MERP) has explored the effects of short- and long-term water level and associated vegetation changes on invertebrate populations. This project has produced an extensive and multi-faceted data set depicting the distribution and variation of invertebrates within a prairie wetland in flux. Artificial substrates were placed at each sampling station at the beginning of the sampling season to provide an index to Gastropodinae and Chironomidae populations colonizing submersed surfaces.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Although amphibians perform key roles in their ecosystems and contribute significantly to biodiversity, especially in tropical habitats, they are frequently excluded from conservation analyses because of a lack of information about their conservation status and distribution. To enhance our knowledge about amphibians and their conservation needs, three organizationsâ\x80\x94the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International, the Species Survival Commission of IUCNâ\x80\x93World Conservation Union, and NatureServeâ\x80\x94launched the Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA) in 2001. The results, published in 2004, represent the first-ever comprehensive status assessment of the world\'s 5,743 known amphibian species. This project represents the first time that all amphibians have been assessed against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and as such is an important contribution to the Red List Programme. More than 500 scientists from 60 countries contributed to the three-year study.\n\nThe GAA produced digital distribution maps for all but 101 of described amphibian species worldwide. The localities for unmapped species, generally including those described more than a century ago, are too vague to permit accurate mapping. NatureServe converted these maps to a format similar to that used for the digital range maps of the birds and mammals of the Western Hemisphere. Ranges are annotated to indicate where species are extant, extirpated, and introduced. In addition, NatureServe has updated dozens of maps of North American species subsequent to the original publication of the GAA.\n\nHere we make these maps available as a free resource for conservationists, researchers, and the general public. To view the map for each species, visit either our InfoNatura or Explorer websites, or the GAA website, search for the species you are interested in, and click on ""Range Map."" To download the map files in ArcView format, see below. The map files can be viewed using ESRI ArcExplorer software, which can be downloaded for free from ESRI\'s website.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands. This data package includes activity trap data, collected as part of the invertebrate section of MERP.\n\tInvertebrate monitoring during the Marsh Ecology Research Project (MERP) has explored the effects of short- and long-term water level and associated vegetation changes on invertebrate populations. This project has produced an extensive and multi-faceted data set depicting the distribution and variation of invertebrates within a prairie wetland in flux. Invertebrate sampling occurred in the controlled MERP cells on the Delta Marsh. Sampling stations within each cell were stratified based on dominant vegetation cover in order to increase sampling efficiency, as this reflects bottom contours. Activity traps were used at sites with standing water to provide an index of free-swimming invertebrates (Murkin et al. 1983).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., P.G.

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION:Increased land development and air pollution are intensifying nitrogen inputs to aquatic ecosystems of the American mountainous west. As a result, the health of mountain lakes and streams are at risk. Recognition of riparian zones as important modulators of stream water chemistry and critical habitat has increased interest in riparian management and restoration. Riparian classifications that reflect differences in ecosystem function can be used to prioritize management and restoration efforts and to develop landscape models of ecological processes. I examined structural and floristic variation in riparian zones of Lake Tahoe Basin and developed an ecosystem type classification for the area. I used this classification to test the hypothesis that ecosystem types can be used to organize the riparian landscape into areas with similar N dynamic and water quality effects. The greatest degree of structural and floristic variation in riparian zones of the Tahoe Basin fell along a gradient of valley form and stream sinuosity. I identified 12 ecosystem types along that gradient and examined N dynamics in five of the 12 types. During 1998 and 1999, I applied N fertilizer to plots representative of these five ecosystem types in a split-plot design. I measured soil N transformations, groundwater chemistry and site factors expected to control N dynamics in each plot. I found significant differences among ecosystem types in N process rates under background conditions. Differences in denitrification were most highly correlated to soil moisture content and groundwater level, while differences in net nitrification were most highly correlated to soil redox. Three ecosystem types had indistinguishably high denitrification responses to added N, whereas the denitrification response of another type was significantly lower than the rest. Groundwater N flux also varied significantly among types under N fertilized conditions: alder-rich ecosystem types had the highest, and grass-meadow ecosystem types had the lowest, groundwater N flux. Results from this research reveal the large structural and functional differences that exist among mountain riparian ecosystem types. These results also suggest that classification of riparian zones into ecosystem types may be useful in predicting landscape scale patterns of riparian zone N dynamics and water quality effects']",['Amy Goodenough Merrill'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.715.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek', 'Riparian', 'Nitrogen Dynamics', 'Lake Tahoe Watershed']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.715.1'],[''],['Variation in the Structure and Nitrogen Dynamics of Mountain Riparian Zones']

"['Study History: Project 320-H received funding in 5 consecutive fiscal years beginning in FY 94 and concluding in FY 98 to investigate the role of zooplankton in processes influencing the survival of juvenile pink salmon and herring; FY 99 was designated a close-out year. Project H was a core component of the larger Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program. Zooplankton serves as food for many fish, bird and marine mammal stocks. SEA investigated its role as forage for juvenile fishes including pink salmon and herring, and also as alternative prey for predators that also consume juvenile pink salmon and herring in seasonally varying complex food webs. Previous annual reports of project 320-H appear in the integrated SEA report series for FY 94, FY 95, FY 96 and FY 97.

Species distribution shifts in response to climate change require that recruitment increase beyond current range boundaries. For trees with long lifespans, the importance of climate-sensitive seedling establishment to the pace of range shifts has not been demonstrated quantitatively. 2. Using spatially explicit, stochastic population models combined with data from long-term forest surveys, we explored whether the climate-sensitivity of recruitment observed in climate manipulation experiments was sufficient to alter populations and elevation ranges of two widely distributed, high-elevation North American conifers. 3. Empirically observed, warming-driven declines in recruitment led to rapid modeled population declines at the low-elevation, â\x80\x9cwarm edgeâ\x80\x9d of subalpine forest and slow emergence of populations beyond the high-elevation, â\x80\x9ccool edgeâ\x80\x9d. Because population declines in the forest occurred much faster than population emergence in the alpine, we observed range contraction for both species. For Engelmann spruce, this contraction was permanent over the modeled time horizon, even in the presence of increased moisture. For limber pine, lower sensitivity to warming may facilitate persistence at low elevations â\x80\x93 especially in the presence of increased moisture â\x80\x93 and rapid establishment above treeline, and, ultimately, expansion into the alpine. 4. Synthesis. Assuming 21st century warming and no additional moisture, population dynamics in high-elevation forests led to transient range contractions for limber pine and potentially permanent range contractions for Engelmann spruce. Thus, limitations to seedling recruitment with warming can constrain the pace of subalpine tree range shifts.""]",['Erin Conlisk'],['ess-dive-0d4c46200485654-20201209T025024468'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['EARTH SCIENCE > BIOSPHERE > ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS', 'EARTH SCIENCE > BIOSPHERE > VEGETATION', 'climate change', 'conifer', 'demographic model', 'range shift', 'subalpine forest', 'time-lag', 'tree line', 'Picea engelmannii Parry ex.

"[""In 1980-8l, I participated in the following research projects at BML.      1. Transport of Amino Acids by Nemertean Worms      In collaboration with G.C. Stephens  (U.C. Irvine), L.M. Crowe,  (U.C. Davis), I have been involved in studies on uptake of amino acids by juvenile nemertean worms found on Dungeness crabs. We have shown that the water found in the joints of the legs, where the worms are also found, contains high concentrations of primary amines.  We have identified these primary amines as amino acids, and have shown that the worms are capable of removing the amino acids from solution.  We have also shown that the source of these amino acids is almost certainly the crabs: using isolated pieces of arthrodial membrane mounted in a miniature Ussing chamber, we have shown that amino acids found in the blood of the crabs can leak across these membranes.  This work produced two publications and a paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in December 1980.      2. Divalent Cations and Membrane Permeability      In collaboration with J.S. Swinehart (U.C. Davis) I have participated in studies on effects of divalent cations on permeability of membranes of bivalve molluscs. We have shown that deletion of Ca   from the medium results in an efflux of amino acids from gills of Mytilus californianus, while Mg   seems to be required for the influx of amino acids into the same tissue.  In addition, we have shown that certain cations such as Ca  , known to have toxic effects on these organisms, stimulates an efflux of amino acids. We suggest that Ca   may displace Ca   bound to the cell membrane, and have provided some evidence to that effect already in our first publication on this subject (Swinehart et al., 1980. J. Exp. Zool.).  Dr. Swinehart presented some of this work at the ASZ meeting in December.     3. Freezing Tolerance of Marine Organisms      In collaboration with L.M. Crowe and S.J. O'Dell (U.C. Davis) I have been involved in studies on freezing of intertidal limpets and cysts of Artemia.  We have shown that limpets collected at Bodega Bay are capable of surviving freezing, with lethal temperatures well below  -lOoC. We have also shown that the lethal temperature may be altered by elevating the [Ca  ] in the blood.  We suspect that this Ca   effect may be related to Ca   binding to cell membranes in these animals, and we are presently investigating this possibility.  One paper on this subject has already been submitted for publication  (OÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99Dall and Crowe, 1980. Cryobiology, Submitted).  Mr. OÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99Dell presented a paper on part of the work at the annual meetings of the Society of Cryobiology in Victoria, B.C. (August 1980).      In the work on Artemia, we have found that cysts survive freezing in liquid nitrogen, provided that their water content is less than 0.6 g H2O/g dry weight.  Thermal analysis showed that the cysts contain 0.6 g unfreezable H2O/g dry weight, so ice is not formed in the animals until higher H2O contents are reached.  This work has been submitted for publication  (Crowe et al., 1980.  Cryobiology.  Submitted), and I presented a paper on the same subject at the annual meeting of the society of Cryobiology in Victoria, B.C. (August 1980).       4.  Other Projects      Our main research efforts are conducted at Davis, where we carry out studies on hydration dependent phase changes in membranes.  While almost none of this work is done at BML, we do use the lab for writing and some minor experimentation, and thus acknowledge the BML on these papers as well as those mentioned above.""]",['John H.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes staff gauge data collected on th experimental cells, as part of MERP.\n\nStudies of marsh ecosystems are frequently hampered by inadequate information about water budgets (Carter et al., 1979). Marshes are often open systems, particularly with respect to movement of water and associated particulate and dissolved materials (Kadlec, 1983). Efforts to evaluate the plant-nutrient relationships in such systems are contingent on knowledge of the hydrology of the system (Kadlec, 1979). Accurate estimates of water budgets are also essential pre-requisites for studies of wetland ecosystem nutrient cycles. Hence, the objective of the measurements described below, together with weather and water level/volume data, was to provide water budgets for nutrient budget calculations for the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP; Kadlec, 1989). The approach to hydrology used was the concept of mass balance:\n\nInputs - Outputs = change in volume\n\nFor this approach, all 3 terms had to be estimated. Change in volume was calculated from daily records of water level and water level - volume tables. Inputs of water to diked cells can be in 3 forms: precipitation, water pumped to maintain design levels, and seepage through the dike or sand ridge forming the north end of the cells. Precipitation inputs were calculated from weather records and pumping was metered, providing direct measurement. Seepage was estimated by difference, with checks based on groundwater topography and hydraulic conductivity, as well as seepage meter spot checks. Outputs of water were evapotranspiration, pumping, and seepage. Seepage out was derived primarily by difference. Because the hydrologic characteristics of different cells in different years were replicated, estimates of the standard error in the seasonal water budgets were possible and proved to be 10% or less (Kadlec, 1989).\n\nNote that precipitation, pumping, evaporation, groundwater level and hydraulic conductivity data for MERP are contained in separate data packages on the KNB.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences: \nCarter, V., M.S.

This data set includes aboveground macrophyte production (MAG; 1980-1989) data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Both clip plot (MAGs; contained in a separate data package on the KNB) and turn-over plot (TOPs) methods were used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). As a single harvesting method would underestimate net primary productivity, turnover plots were used to correct the data. \n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. There is some data on non-salmon species (whitefish, sheefish, longnose sucker, Dolly Varden) in the Yukon dataset. There is an additional data table for more specific information about the locations where samples were collected. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data files, reformatting scripts that reformat the original data files into a consistent format, and the reformatted datasets.']",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1K64GBK'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['age, sex, length']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1K64GBK'],[''],"['Salmon age, sex, and length data from Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Region of Alaska, 1960-2017']"
"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present.

A mitigating factor is that the land usage in the surrounding upland areas is much less intense and high quality water from this part of the landscape drains downslope as surface water but once it reaches the valley floor seeps into the outwash and joins (mixes with?) the recharge water from the intensively used valley floor.\n\nIn 1974 a water quality monitoring network was established on and near the Cornell Teaching and Research Center near Harford NY.  This is an ideal location to study the effect of farming (mostly dairy) on the nitrate and phosphorus in streams and aquifers in a typical outwash valley with its surrounding upland areas. First, a major ground water divide runs through the center of the farm; part draining to Fall Creek and the other to the Susquehanna River. This means that we know where all of the water originates. Secondly, Cornell University owns the land except for some upland areas that so far (2007) are mostly wooded/abandoned agricultural land. This simplifies access, information on usage and in some cases control management.\n\nThe objectives were a) to monitor behavior of aquifers in the gravel outwash and b) monitor water quality in the aquifers and surrounding uplands.\n\nIn 1974 a cooperative program was developed between Cornell University and the USGS. In early 1974 Allan Randall of the USGS guided the location and instillation of 8 monitoring wells. Following the initial 8 wells, additional shallow wells were installed.

During this period about 40% of the recharge to the aquifers was derived from precipitation on the area over the aquifers and 60% runoff from the uplands. Ground-water discharged down-valley as underflow about equaled recharge during this period.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Ã\x82Âº07'S, Long. 139Ã\x82Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons.

The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush).

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records.

To study the effects of grazing on these seedlings outside the reserve, three populations were identified and measured to the north of the fence, and a fourth population just south of the fence, i.e. on the reserve. Different fencing treatments were applied to the plants outside the reserve fence. One was protected from sheep, the second from both sheep and rabbits, the third left unprotected.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Âº07'S, Long. 139Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons. Several species of Senna, Eremophila and other shrubs also occur.; Monitoring activities: Some or all of the following monitoring activities are carried out during visits to the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve: Vegetation Quadrats, Photopoints, Senna Quadrat (Cassia Corner), Myoporum platycarpum Plants, Saltbush Transects, Senna Populations, Kangaroo Transects, Rabbit Activity Monitoring and Control.; Kangaroo Transects: Many very young Senna seedlings were identified close to the Northern boundary of the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve, both inside and outside of the reserve in 1997.

Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Ã\x82Âº07'S, Long. 139Ã\x82Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons. Several species of Senna, Eremophila and other shrubs also occur.; Monitoring activities: Some or all of the following monitoring activities are carried out during visits to the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve: Vegetation Quadrats, Photopoints, Senna Quadrat (Cassia Corner), Myoporum platycarpum Plants, Saltbush Transects, Senna Populations, Kangaroo Transects, Rabbit Activity Monitoring and Control.; Senna Populations: Many very young Senna seedlings were identified close to the Northern boundary of the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve, both inside and outside of the reserve in 1997. To study the effects of grazing on these seedlings outside the reserve, three populations were identified and measured to the north of the fence, and a fourth population just south of the fence, i.e. on the reserve. Different fencing treatments were applied to the plants outside the reserve fence. One was protected from sheep, the second from both sheep and rabbits, the third left unprotected. The population inside the reserve was assumed to be protected from all grazing by the reserve fence.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration.

"[""Environment          \tHastings saw the drought continue into the third year with total precipitation of only 12.92 in. compared to the average total of 21.15 in. observed over the last 48 years. The Arnold Spring gradually decreased in flow and by March was no longer providing water for the community. Showers in May extended the growing season of wildflowers and the annual grasses. Pumping from the Hastings well for domestic water increased to almost daily frequency in June.          \tWe had no wildfires. Snow fell on December 24th (3 in.) and again in early January. Finch Creek flowed in the winter, but by mid-May was dry at Martin Road. Surface water in Finch Creek dried entirely on the reserve by late June. Acorns were not plentiful, but the Acorn Woodpeckers were able to sustain normal breeding. Rooting by feral pigs was significantly reduced on most transects monitored.               Research          Museum of Vertebrate Zoology-Hastings Staff          Resident staff once again accounted for most of the research at Hastings (Table 1).          \tResearch Ecologist Dr. James Griffin continued his research studies of the ecology of California's oak woodlands. A new experimental study was designed and implemented to assess specific causes of mortality in oak seedlings. Nine hundred acorns were planted in screen pots and monitored. Dr. Griffin remains very active in statewide advisory coimittees with regard to conservation research in oak biology. Dr. Griffin was requested to consult with a variety of public and private organizations with regard to oak woodland or rare plant management.          \tAcademic Coordinator Dr. Mark Stromberg continued with preparation of manuscripts dealing with research conducted previous to assuming administrative duties at Hastings. Research regarding the roles of small mammals in the conservation biology of California oak woodlands is the subject of proposals for research support being sought from the Packard Foundation and the Carmel Ranch Company.          \tResearch Associate Dr. Janis Dickinson initiated studies of local wasp colonies and of leaf beetles on local milkweed plants. Dr. Dickinson authored 2 papers which were published this year. Dr. Dickinson presented 4 papers at various scientific meetings and co-taught a graduate seminar on social behavior on the Berkeley campus. Dr. Dickinson was an editorial reviewer for three refereed journals.          \tResearch Zoologist Dr. Walter Koenig continued several studies of social behavior in birds. Dr. Koenig completed the 18th consecutive year of detailed study of Acorn Woodpeckers in over 35 social groups on and adjacent to Hastings. Research on the effects of tannins on the digestive efficiency of Acorn Woodpeckers was published, as were results of his studies of human dispersal patterns. Dr. Koenig's studies of breeding in 363 nest boxes used by Western Bluebirds entered its 6th year. Dr. Koenig published 5 research papers, was elected as a fellow to the American Ornithologist's Union, served as Fulbright Fellow at the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, and co-authored a grant application to the Genetic Resources Conservation Program (UC-Davis) which     was approved for an ultracold freezer to store genetic resources at the Hastings Reservation. Dr. Koenig presented 8 lectures and co-taught a graduate seminar on social behavior. He was an advisor for a Master's Thesis completed this year, served on two Ph.D. committees at UC Berkeley and was an external examiner on a Ph.D. thesis at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Koenig also reviewed articles for 7 professional organizations. Various scientific papers by Hasting staff are listed in Appendix 1.          \tLong-term monitoring projects continue at Hastings. Dr. Koenig and his field assistants completed the 14th year of sampling insect populations in pan traps. Dr. Carmen sampled oaks for the 9th year in a cooperative study with Dr. Koenig of acorn production based on 250 tagged oak trees on the reservation. Dr. Griffin added the 21st year of sampling grassland productivity on Hastings. Floristic data (plant species listed by their relative abundance) were taken from plots established 20 years ago. Dr. Griffin made new maps of several plots where individual grassland plants were mapped 12 years ago. Dr. Griffin re-sampled, 40 vegetation research plots in the Chew's Ridge area which burned in the Marble Cone fire in August of 1978. Weather data were updated and correlations were compiled between the new automatic weather recording system and the older data base.          U.C. Berkeley Students          \tMost graduate students who worked at Hastings (Table 2) were once again from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ). Mark Stanback added his fifth year of field studies of the Acorn Woodpecker, focusing on behavior of the birds during the nesting period. David Ribble spent the year gathering his third year of data on movements and social behavior of the small mammals on Hastings, with emphasis on the California deer mouse. Mark Reynolds spent about half of this reporting period working to complete six years of research on social behavior and movements of the Yellow-billed Magpie: Mark Reynolds left Hastings for a position with the UC Berkeley system as manager of the Sagehen Field Station. Philip Hooge moved to Hastings to study dispersal patterns of Acorn Woodpeckers. Pat Kelly conducted field work which added his 5th year of data on the local population of wood rats, a species studied previously by Linsdale and Tevis.          \tSeveral other MVZ graduate students visited Hastings. Devin Reese surveyed the lizard populations. Maria daSilva spent several days getting acquainted with the mammalian fauna. Elizabeth Ross assisted with several research projects.          \tPam Muick (UC Forestry) continued her research on the ecology of native oak trees with Dr. Griffin. John Barthell (UC Entomology) conducted surveys for Africanized bees and documented the seasonal activity of native bees.          \tGraduate students using Hastings are listed in Table 2. Graduate students from schools other than UC Berkeley used Hastings as well (Table 2).          Other U.C. Research          \tFaculty from other California institutions spent time at Hastings (Table 1). Dr. Jeff Welker and Dr. Kevin Rice (UC Davis) made annual visits to their ongoing oak regeneration study plots. Dr. Dan Botkin visited to see the reserve and visit with the researchers. Dr. Sara Hrdy (UC Davis) visited with Dr. Walter Koenig with regard to social behavior studies. Dr. Robbie Soltz revisited bee study sites established over 10 years ago.     \tDr. Gordon Frankie, U.C. Berkeley-Entomology and his student, John Barthell, again monitored ,a series of traps for the presence of any Africanized bees.          \tRay Calloway, UC Santa Barbara, made several trips to Hastings to monitor his oak seedling, study plots. Ray is funded through the Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program. Beth Hendrickson (UC Santa Barbara), working with Dr. Griffin, studied the local turpentine weed, Trichostema lanceolatum          Research by Other Institutions          \tThe largest new research program to start at Hastings was that of Dr. Paul Ewald of Amherst College. Funded by NSF for 2 years, Dr. Ewald arrived June 15 to spend the, summer gathering data on territorial behavior of resident hummingbirds. Dr. Ewald and his assistants set up several patches of electronically controlled robotic flowers with artificial nectar. Observations and behavior data were entered directly into portable computers.          \tDr. Tom Nash, Arizona State University, was successful in seeking NSF support to re-establish his research program on the lichen, Ramalina in the spring of 1990. Dr. Ron Mumme (Memphis State University) visited Hastings as part of his continuing collaboration with Dr. Koenig on Acorn Woodpeckers. Dr. Tim Pritchard visited as a part of a tour of biological field stations. Dr. Tim Plumb and Dr. Larry Riggs were here to follow up on continuing oak tree studies and collaborate with Dr. Griffin. Dr. Joe Marshall (USFWS- National Museum) was here to study winter bird flocks. Dr. Stan Faeth (Arizona State University) established some monitoring stations for insects which affect oak growth. Dr. Dave Gubernick (Univ. Wisconsin-Madison) videotaped California deer mice in their subterranean dens with Dave Ribble. Dr. Don Kramer (McGill) visited with Dr. Koenig to observe Acorn Woodpeckers. Bennie Hannah, a student at Cal Poly, made several trips to monitor other oak regeneration plots.               Education          \tClass use at Hastings is summarized in Table 3. Four classes with a total of 57 students used Hastings for natural history studies. Class use of Hastings remains limited by the lack of a group facility.          \tHastings continues to offer an important educational experience for undergraduates who wish to work with advanced researchers in field biology. Dr. Koenig and his students Mark Stanback and Phil Hooge, worked with 9 field assistants this year (Table 4). Dave Ribble trained 6 field assistants to track the movements of deermice in undisturbed microhabitats of Hastings woodlands. Dr. Jim Griffin was assisted in his studies of the vegetation of the Santa Lucia mountains by a student from Stanford. The wide variety of field assistant involvement at Hastings is summarized in Table 4.          \tIn a program which is scheduled to continue through next year, Dr. Paul Ewald directed a group of 5 field assistants in his study of the territorial behavior of hummingbirds. Each of his assistants is preparing independent research papers in addition to collecting data for the larger research project directed by Dr. Ewald.""]",['Mark R.

"['Study History: Project 320-H received funding in 5 consecutive fiscal years beginning in FY 94 and concluding in FY 98 to investigate the role of zooplankton in processes influencing the survival of juvenile pink salmon and herring; FY 99 was designated a close-out year. Project H was a core component of the larger Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program. Zooplankton serves as food for many fish, bird and marine mammal stocks. SEA investigated its role as forage for juvenile fishes including pink salmon and herring, and also as alternative prey for predators that also consume juvenile pink salmon and herring in seasonally varying complex food webs. Previous annual reports of project 320-H appear in the integrated SEA report series for FY 94, FY 95, FY 96 and FY 97. This final report includes work completed in FY 98.\n\nThe data for this project was pulled from the UAF School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences public data portal at the following URL: http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/dm/ims-data-archive/DataBase/ZOOPLANKTON/PWS-SEA/.

"[""This survey is part of the Biological Survey of SA programme run by the Biological Survey & Monitoring group in DEH. Survey areas defined in a DEH spatial layer managed by DEH Environmental Information Group. The survey sampled, described and mapped the vegetation and recorded the associated fauna from as many as possible of South Australia's offshore islands. All offshore islands from Nuyts Reef in the west to Penguin Island in the South East of South Australia were visited between 1971 and 1982. Several groups of islands are not covered including the islands in Pelican Lagoon on Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island itself and the islands in the Coorong Lagoon. Torrens and Garden Islands, the mangroves and saltmarsh covered islands north of Port Adelaide and Entrance Island in Franklin Harbour are excluded, as they are better treated as part of the mangrove complex along the St Vincent Gulf and Spencer Gulf coasts. The Offshore Islands Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.

"[""The Tothill Ranges, is a low range (up to 650m above SL) running 15km south-north, north-east of Marrabel. It contains the largest area of remnant vegetation in the Northern & Yorke NRM Board region that is outside the DEH reserve system. Part of the Northern Mount Lofty Ranges, both the size and position of this remnant sitting in 'a sea' of cleared land ensures the conservation of this area is paramount in the protection of biodiversity of this region. The Tothill Ranges sit on the eastern edge of the Northern Agricultural area, the western edge of the Murray Darling Basin near Hopkins Creek Conservation Park and is less than 80 km south east of the Southern Flinders. It has been listed as both the largest remnant and key area in managing salinity in the Upper River Light Catchment (Upper Light River Salinity Management Plan 2003). The Nature Conservation Society South Australia will be conducting flora and fauna surveys, using standard Biological Survey of SA methodology over 10 days (Sep-Oct 2008), at 16 sites in privately owned land being managed for conservation.

"['The 1971+ Tropical Rainforest Plot Network Rainforest Tree Demographic Data contains stem measurement data from 20 permanent  0.5 ha (100 m x 50 m) rainforest plots in Northern Queensland, Australia. The CSIRO permanent rainforest plots are located within 60 km of the north Queensland coast between Mackay (21.5ÂºS, 149ÂºE) and the Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (12.5ÂºS, 143ÂºE). The plots have a rainfall range of 1200 to 3500 mm, represent eleven vegetation types, six parent materials, and range from 15 m to 1200 m above sea level. Except for minor disturbances associated with selective logging on two plots, the plots were established in old growth forest and all plots have thereafter been protected. Plots were regularly censused and at each census the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all stems â\x89¥10 cm DBH is recorded.  Due to the wide geographical range of the plots, no species dominate, although the families Lauraceae, Rutaceae and Myrtaceae contribute a large number of species. The data collected from these 20 plots provides an insight into the floristical composition, structure and long term forest dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests and allows direct comparisons to be made with long-term monitoring plots at a global scale.

"[""The project is to undertake surveys of fauna and flora in remnant vegetation on private land in the Southern Flinders Ranges, southern Yorke Peninsula, and other priority areas in the Northern and Yorke NRM Region. The aim of the project is to support landscape conservation and restoration of native fauna and flora habitat in the Northern & Yorke region. To achieve this we need a better understanding of the species and habitat areas present on private land. We will then use this information to support and directly involve land owners/managers in active management of the natural biodiversity on their properties. The project is based around groups of interested landholders in signifcant biodiversity areas of the region. Participation of adjoining landholders will be encouraged, to achieve a landscape approach to habitat restoration and management. The project will improve regional knowledge of native fauna and flora and contribute new data to the BDBSA database. It will also develop the skills of DENR staff, NRM staff and land owners/managers in plant and animal identification, safe and ethical animal trapping practises and animal handling techniques. Project started in 2010 and is ongoing.

"[""The project is to undertake surveys of fauna and flora in remnant vegetation on private land in the Southern Flinders Ranges, southern Yorke Peninsula, and other priority areas in the Northern and Yorke NRM Region. The aim of the project is to support landscape conservation and restoration of native fauna and flora habitat in the Northern & Yorke region. To achieve this we need a better understanding of the species and habitat areas present on private land. We will then use this information to support and directly involve land owners/managers in active management of the natural biodiversity on their properties. The project is based around groups of interested landholders in signifcant biodiversity areas of the region. Participation of adjoining landholders will be encouraged, to achieve a landscape approach to habitat restoration and management. The project will improve regional knowledge of native fauna and flora and contribute new data to the BDBSA database. It will also develop the skills of DENR staff, NRM staff and land owners/managers in plant and animal identification, safe and ethical animal trapping practises and animal handling techniques. Project started in 2010 and is ongoing. The BIODIVERSITY ON PRIVATE LAND, NORTHERN & YORKE Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.

All offshore islands from Nuyts Reef in the west to Penguin Island in the South East of South Australia were visited between 1971 and 1982. Several groups of islands are not covered including the islands in Pelican Lagoon on Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island itself and the islands in the Coorong Lagoon. Torrens and Garden Islands, the mangroves and saltmarsh covered islands north of Port Adelaide and Entrance Island in Franklin Harbour are excluded, as they are better treated as part of the mangrove complex along the St Vincent Gulf and Spencer Gulf coasts.

"[""The SWATT is an initiative developed collaboratively by TERN's Australian Transect Network and the Department of Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia (DPaW). The SWATT is one of four national ecological transects or plot networks that traverse key Australian terrestrial ecosystems. The principal purpose of the transects is to measure selected biodiversity attributes along with biophysical processes, that will inform key ecosystem science questions and assist with the development and validation of ecosystem models. Transects will enable benchmarking and subsequent monitoring of trends in ecological condition in response to continental scale biophysical processes such as climate change. The SWATT is located in the south west of Western Australian extending for over 1,200km from Walpole on the south coast to just beyond the former pastoral lease of Lorna Glen and into the Little Sandy Desert.  The SWATT incorporates the internationally recognised biodiversity hotspot that is the Southwest Botanical Province (Myers et al. 2000, Hopper P &amp; Gioia 2004), a national biodiversity hotspot (Central and Eastern Avon Wheatbelt) and the evolutionary significant species rich Southwest Interzone (Hopper 1979, Gibson et al. 2010) which includes the globally significant Great Western Woodlands (GWW) (Watson et al. 2009).

"['The Tropical Rainforest Plot Network Rainforest Understorey Floristic Data contains understorey floristic data from all 20 of its 0.5 ha (100 m x 50 m) permanent rainforest plots in Northern Queensland, Australia. Data was collected for all plots at the time of establishment before 1981 and data was again collected for half of the plots post-2000.    The CSIRO permanent rainforest plots are located within 60 km of the north Queensland coast between Mackay (21.5ÂºS, 149ÂºE) and the Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (12.5ÂºS, 143ÂºE). The plots have a rainfall range of 1200 to 3500 mm, represent eleven vegetation types, six parent materials, and range from 15 m to 1200 m above sea level. Except for minor disturbances associated with selective logging on two plots, the plots were established in old growth forest and all plots have thereafter been protected.  In conjunction with the Tree Demographic Data packages which have been collected by the Tropical Rainforest Plot Network, the data collected from these 20 plots provides an insight into the floristical composition, structure and long term forest dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests and allows direct comparisons to be made with long-term monitoring plots at a global scale.

"['Hummingbirds have a unique foraging life style requiring frequent nectar feedings to maintain high energetic needs. Thus they depend on and provide pollination service to native plants in their habitats. With an energetic life on the edge coupled with specific habitat requirements for breeding, wintering, and migration movement corridors, climate change and human-caused habitat alteration is of special concern for hummingbirds and their ecological communities. However, the scientific literature is lacking for many important aspects of hummingbird biology including population structure, genetic diversity, migration, and impacts of diseases. Two sympatric partial migrant hummingbird species are present in California and both reside on the Channel Islands. ""Partial migrant"" means that some members of the species migrate, while others remain in an area year-round. Recent improvements in methods of capture and noninvasive sampling provide an excellent mechanism to test hypotheses about differences in ecology, health, population structure and genetic diversity in island vs. mainland hummingbirds.This research involves the field study and laboratory analyses for two partial migrant species in California, Anna\'s Hummingbird (Calypte anna; Anna\'s) and Allen\'s Hummingbird (Selasphorus sasin; Allen\'s). Objectives include testing 1) whether migratory and sedentary populations are genetically distinct and how populations are substructured in relation to geography and landscape features and 2) if presence of a disease syndrome observed in mainland California hummingbirds is present on the islands and whether the disease is associated with migratory strategy.  Migratory Allen\'s and Anna\'s are hypothesized to be genetically distinct from their sedentary conspecifics. Anna\'s Hummingbirds with pox-like disease syndrome are hypothesized to more likely be migrators due to factors possibly including lowered immunity imposed by stresses of migration and higher exposure to insect vectors of disease. A synergy of specialized capture techniques, molecular genetics, and stable isotope analysis will be used to address these questions then produce a predictive model for distributions and abundance of migrating and sedentary populations given current forecasts for climate change.']",['Holly Ernest'],['nrs.908.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[[""Anna's Hummingbirds"", 'sedentary populations', 'migrating populations', 'disease', 'genetics', ""Allen's Hummingbirds"", 'geography', 'landscape', 'climatic changes']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/nrs.908.1'],[''],"['Hummingbird Health, Ecology, and Genetics']"
"['Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection routinely observed in California sea lions, but characterized by outbreaks (every four to five years) when large numbers of affected sea lions come ashore along the coast of California. Among those that are admitted to rehabilitation for this disease, mortality is quite high (~70%), suggesting that this disease may affect population numbers. A missing piece of information needed to understand the disease cycles in California sea lions is whether individuals can act as maintenance hosts for Leptospira, i.e. whether individual sea lions can become chronic carriers of the pathogen while exhibiting few or no signs of disease. Testing clinically healthy, wild-caught sea lions for this pathogen will help us determine prevalence of exposure as well as the prevalence of sea lions that are shedding the pathogen and potentially capable of infecting other sea lions. We propose to sample apparently healthy sea lions on Ano Nuevo Island and test their blood and urine for Leptospira. Maintenance hosts will be identified by the combination of an absence of clinical illness (normal serum chemistry), little to no antibody titer against Leptospira spp. (serology), and the concurrent shedding of viable leptospires in the urine (positive PCR or culture). These data will provide an important piece of information to aid in efforts to model the disease dynamics of Leptospira within the sea lion population and to understand the affect of this pathogen on the California sea lion population.']",['Denise Greig'],['nrs.869.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['leptospirosis', 'California sea lion']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/nrs.869.1'],[''],['Assessing mechanisms of persistence of Leptospira spp in California sea lions']

"[""Subsistence users from the remote Alaska Peninsula Native Village of Perryville had noted significant declines in the coho salmon run in the nearby Kametolook River since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The Trustee Council began funding a project in Federal Fiscal Year 1997 (October 1, 1996 - September 30, 1997) with the intent of restoring this coho salmon run. This project was a continuation of an evaluative phase of the project funded through the EVOS criminal settlement (Grant Agreement Number 21685881 May through September 1996). The criminal settlement funded the project for an assessment team from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and local assistants from the Native Village of Perryville. The assessment period determined the preferred method to restore the Kametolook River's coho salmon run to historic levels. This phase ended with the approval of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in May 1997. The EA and project review supported instream incubation boxes as the preferred restoration alternative.\n\nAnnually, every November 1997 through 2001, coho salmon eggs were placed in two Kametolook River instream incubation boxes to improve the green egg to fry survival over natural in-river conditions. Since, 1997, the Kametolook River coho escapement has shown some improvement. The later coho salmon escapement level can also be partially attributed to self-imposed in-river harvest restrictions by the villagers and commercial fishing restrictions in marine waters. Community involvement and use of local traditional ecological knowledge by the villagers of Perryville was also an integral part of the projects plan toward the restoration of Kametolook River coho salmon as a subsistence resource. Kametolook River coho escapement estimates didn't increase significantly over the six years of the project as hoped. This is due in part to the low number of annual returning adult coho salmon available for the egg takes and natural spawning.\n\nIn 1999, The Perryville Subsistence Workgroup was formed to address the subsistence needs of Perryville residents and has remained active throughout the remainder of this project. This group is currently seeking funding that will allow the egg box project to continue beyond September 2002. In addition, this group also hopes to obtain genetic and pathology samples of nearby coho systems (fish transport permit requirements) and the eventual transport of eggs from these systems to the Kametolook River egg boxes. This additional work should increase escapements in the Kametolook River and thus provide more eggs for the incubation boxes and eventually a surplus of adult coho salmon available for Perryville residents' subsistence fishing.\n\nAlso as part of the project, starting in 1996 a school aquarium project for the Perryville School was set up and maintained annually throughout all project years. Annually approximately 300 to 500 fertilized coho salmon eggs were placed in the Perryville school aquarium and students followed the development of the eggs to the swim up fry stage. The teachers developed lesson plans in biology and ecology around the aquarium project and developed a stewardship of the local salmon runs with the students.""]",['Lisa Hutchinson-Scarbrough'],['df35i.17.6'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Alaska Penninsula', 'Alaska Department of Fish and Game', 'Chignik Regional Aquaculture Association', 'coho salmon', 'community involvement', 'environmental assessment', 'Exxon Valdez oil spill', 'instream incubation boxes', 'net holding pens', 'Kametolook River', 'Perryville', 'Perryville School', 'Perryville Village Council', 'Perryville Subsistence Workgroup', 'school aquarium', 'subsitence', 'traditioanl and ecological knowledge', 'Exxon Valdez', 'oil spill', 'Alaska', 'EVOS', 'EVOSTC', 'Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/df35i.17.6'],[''],"['Kametolook River Coho Salmon Subsistence Project, Perryville, Alaska (1997 - 2002).']"

"['Study History: Restoration Project 01064 began in 1993 as a continuation of the initial post-spill study effort conducted as Marine Mammal Study Number 5 (Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas) in 1989 through 1991 and reclassified as Restoration Study Number 73 (Harbor Seal Restoration Study) in 1992. A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report . Fatty acid studies funded under Restoration Project 94320-F (Trophic Interactions of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound) were included in the 1994 annual report for 94064. Fatty acid studies were continued and reported as part of this study for the duration of the project.\n\nAbstract: Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi) were captured in the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, Prince William Sound (PWS), and Kodiak Island during 1976-1999. Blood was collected from 286 seals. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1 (PhoHV-1), phocid herpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2), and phocine distemper virus (PDV). Antibody prevalence rates were 46% (46/100) for Brucella spp., 93% (225/243) for PhoHV-1, 0% (0/286) for PhHV-2, and 1% (2/160) for PDV. Antibody prevalence for Brucella spp. was directly related to host age. Antibody prevalence for PhoHV-1 was higher in PWS as compared to the other three regions. No evidence of mortality attributable to these four agents was observed during the course of this study. Based on the results of this survey, none of these agents is considered a significant mortality factor in harbor seals from the four regions of coastal Alaska included in the study.\n\nPublications:\nFrost, K.J., L.F.

"['These data are part of the Herring Program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC) which is a multi-faceted program to determine why herring populations in Prince William Sound remain depressed since the early 1990s. As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations. A list of these projects and the associated EVOS project numbers is provided in Supplemental Information.']",['Mary Anne Bishop'],['10.24431_rw1k32t_201997192027'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['In Situ/Laboratory Instruments > Samplers > Trawls/Nets > GILLNETS', 'In Situ/Laboratory Instruments > Samplers > Trawls/Nets', 'EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > COASTAL PROCESSES > ESTUARIES', 'EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > COASTAL PROCESSES > FJORDS', 'EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH > RAY-FINNED FISHES > ANCHOVIES/HERRINGS', 'sub-Arctic', 'Prince William Sound', 'Clupea pallasii', 'Pacific herring', 'predator avoidance', 'acoustic validation', 'forage fish', 'fjord', 'bay', 'estuary', 'age-0', 'juvenile', 'adult', 'EVOS Herring Research and Monitoring', 'EVOS Herring Survey', 'EVOS Herring', 'EVOSTC', 'Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council', 'oil spill', 'Exxon Valdez', 'OCEAN > PACIFIC OCEAN > NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN > GULF OF ALASKA', 'CONTINENT > NORTH AMERICA > UNITED STATES OF AMERICA > ALASKA', 'Chrysaora melanaster', 'Aurelia aurita', 'moon jelly, moon jelly', 'Aequorea', 'Cyanea capillata', ""lion's mane, lion's mane"", 'Gadus chalcogrammus', 'Walleye Pollock', 'Hypomesus pretiosus', 'surf smelt', 'Podothecus accipenserinus', 'sturgeon poacher', 'Platichthys stellatus', 'starry flounder', 'Lumpenus sagitta', 'snake prickleback', 'Lumpenus fabricii', 'slender eelblenny, lompÃ©nie Ã©lancÃ©e', 'Eleginus gracilis', 'saffron cod', 'Lepidopsetta bilineata', 'rock sole', 'Sebastes maliger', 'quillback rockfish', 'Zaprora silenus', 'prowfish', 'Microgadus proximus', 'Pacific tomcod', 'Leptocottus armatus', 'Pacific staghorn sculpin, charrasco de astas', 'Eumicrotremus orbis', 'Pacific spiny lumpsucker', 'Trichodon trichodon', 'Pacific sandfish', 'Ammodytes hexapterus', 'Pacific sand lance', 'Hippoglossus stenolepis', 'Pacific halibut, alabato del PacÃ\xadfico', 'Gadus macrocephalus', 'Pacific cod, morue du Pacifique, bacalao del Pacifico', 'Ophiodon elongatus', 'lingcod, molva', 'Hexagrammos decagrammus', 'kelp greenling', 'Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus', 'great sculpin', 'Thaleichthys pacificus', 'eulachon', 'Blepsias bilobus', 'crested sculpin', 'Pholis laeta', 'crescent gunnel', 'Mallotus villosus villosus', 'capelin', 'Syngnathus leptorhynchus', 'bay pipefish, slendernosed pipefish, pez pipa de bahÃ\xada', 'Clupea pallasii', 'Pacific herring, arenque del PacÃ\xadfico', 'Winter']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/10.24431_rw1k32t_201997192027'],[''],"['Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program']"

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: The yellow-billed magpie is a highly social corvid that breeds in loosely spaced colonies.  Nesting close to conspecifics, rather than nesting in dispersed locations, is known to increase competition (for food, nest sites and mates) and increase the spread of disease and parasites. For coloniality to be evolutionarily stable, some benefit, or combination of benefits, must counter these inherent costs. Among several alternative hypotheses for the evolution of avian coloniality, I examined a model which relates the variability of foraging areas to selection for nesting in colonies. In a simple model, Horn showed that when resources were evenly distributed, breeding pairs nesting in dispersed locations had shorter average travel distances to foraging areas than pairs nesting in a cluster. When resources were clumped in space and time, breeding pairs nesting colonially in a central location had shorter average travel distances to unpredictable foraging areas. Thus, the minimization of travel distance to foraging areas will select for coloniality when resources are clumped in space and time. The model makes several assumptions: 1. Food resources must be spatially and temporally variable while the colony is occupied. 2. Colony locations should be near the Â\x91center of massÂ\x92 of the food distribution. 3. Every colony member should forage throughout the entire foraging area exploited by the colony. The modelÂ\x92s prediction is that, given these assumptions, mean travel distances should be shorter for colony members than those calculated for members of a hypothetical population of equal size that is dispersed over the same food distribution. I evaluated the assumptions and prediction of HornÂ\x92s model using field data from a long-term study of yellow-billed magpies. Yellow-billed magpie nests were clustered relative to available habitat and individuals were not forced to nest in colonies because of habitat limitation. The location of good foraging areas varied significantly in space and time. Yellow-billed magpie colonies were roughly centrally located with respect to the distribution of food. Foraging areas were not defended and individual home ranges, as determined by radio telemetry, exhibited significant overlap. Consistent with HornÂ\x92s model, mean travel distances were significantly shorter for colony  members than those calculated for members of hypothetical populations of equal size that were dispersed over the same food distribution.']",['Mark DuValle Reynolds'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.700.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek Basin', 'Yellow-Billed Magpie', 'colonial nesting']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.700.1'],[''],['The Ecology of Spacing Behavior in the Yellow-Billed Magpie (Pica nuttalli)']

"['Project goals: The goal of this project is to establish a network of research plots in woody vegetation of Sonoma County, California (in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area). The objective of plot installation is to assess species distributions and community structure along abiotic gradients and to serve as a baseline for long-term studies of vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and other drivers. This field study is integrated with ongoing monitoring of weather and climate and was designed relative to downscaled projections of future climate and water balance and projected vegetation change through the end of the 21st century.\n\nPrimary objectives:\n1. To examine woodland vegetation community structure and species composition across fine-scale topographic and hydrologic gradients, providing a baseline for monitoring long-term change.\n2. With additional focus on:\n- The effects of plot orientation to marine layer, aspect, topographic position\n- Distribution and possible hybridization between blue and Oregon oak, closely related species with\noverlapping geographic range at Pepperwood Preserve\n- Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) succession and effects of removal for oak woodland management\n3. To create an infrastructure for future projects studying ecology and species interactions in woody plant communities occurring on contrasting topographic and hydrologic gradients.\n\nWhy this is important: Woodland and forest vegetation represents critical habitat in natural communities of the Bay Area, supporting a wide diversity of plant and animal species. A range of ecological processes can lead to vegetation change in these communities, including ecological succession, disease (e.g. sudden oak death), invasive species, changes in herbivore community, and wildfire. In the 21st century, rapid climate change is also expected to cause dramatic impacts on native plant communities. Climate will interact with the processes above, and may also cause direct impacts via drought, heat waves, etc. Detecting the impacts of climate change on vegetation requires long-term research, with quantitative baseline data and repeated resurveys. This projected established a network of permanent plots for longterm monitoring and demographic research on climate change and the interaction with other factors that may impact native vegetation.\n\nProject overview: Fifty 20 x 20 m plots were established across topographic and hydrologic gradients throughout the preserve. Within each plot all saplings (>50 cm tall) and trees (> 1 cm diameter at breast height) were permanently tagged, identified, mapped and measured. All seedlings (<10 cm tall) and juveniles (10-50 cm tall) were counted and identified.

Hydroacoustic (sonar) surveys were repeated over winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 in both bays. Surveys were conducted during the night, when herring are known to come near the surface (which makes them more accessible to hydroacoustic methods), using a BioSonics 124 kHz digital split-beam transducer mounted down-looking on an aluminum towfin. The dataset consists of intermediary files (in CSV format) of acoustic backscatter outputted by the Echoview program in the form of the area backscatter coefficient (sa, m2 m-2) from raw acoustic source data files (in *.DT4 format generated by BioSonics DT system).

The purpose of this study was to examine the genetic stock structure of herring within PWS and the connections to herring stocks outside of PWS. Herring were collected from 2012 to 2015 in eastern and western PWS, and several locations adjacent to PWS, including Southeast Alaska, Yakutat and Kayak Island, Cook Inlet, Shelikof Strait, and Kodiak Island for genetic analysis. Bering Sea herring collected from 2005 to 2008 were included as outliers. This dataset is a single comma-separated values (csv) file containing genetic information obtained from thirteen microsatellite loci and mtDNA cytochrome b (cytb) sequences. Genetic analyses was conducted at the NOAA- Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories in Juneau, Alaska. Analyses of the microsatellite loci show that allele frequencies of herring collections in eastern PWS are homogenous among bays, between year classes, and over years. Collections from Montague Island and Evans Island (western PWS) indicated a weak signal of differentiation from eastern PWS collections. PWS herring are genetically similar to herring east of PWS (Kayak Island and Yakutat), but are significantly different than herring west of PWS (Kodiak, Cook Inlet, and Shelikof Strait).

This project tested the assumption of no migration by monitoring the fatty acid composition of wild age-0 herring over winter in PWS, and in a laboratory study. The dataset is five comma-separated value (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. Herring were sampled from various bays in eastern and western PWS in early winter and repeated at the end of winter in 2010 - 2012, under the EVOS Herring Survey program (EVOS project numbers 12120111-I, 13120111-I). For the laboratory component testing the validity of the fatty acid approach, we used fish collected near the NOAA Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL, Juneau, Alaska). Fish were collected by beach seine in autumn 2011, transferred to ABL and divided into two groups. The groups were fed different diets to create two groups with distinct fatty acid compositions. Each of the groups had a fasted component and a second component that was fed a reduced ration to generate an energy deficit. Captive fish were sampled for fatty acid analysis through April 2012.

"['These data are part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132-G), of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council which is a multi-faceted study to determine why herring populations in Prince William Sound remain depressed since the early 1990s. Our fish predators on juvenile herring project dataset is 11 comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database with a graphical relationship chart. The original dataset is also provided in Microsoft Acces(.acdb format). The data contain measurements of fish predator abundance and distribution in relation to juvenile herring in a series of bays in Prince William Sound during the 2009/10 through 2011/12 winters. Specifically, fish collections took place during November and March over three winters, beginning in November 2009 and ending March 2012. We deployed 79 longline sets including 61 sets at the five core bays (Eaglek, Lower Herring, Simpson, Whale, and Zaikof). Longlines were set near schools of herring located during hydroacoustic surveys conducted the previous day. For all six cruises we supplemented information on potential predators using variable-mesh gill nets placed perpendicular to shore. For each cruise, we collected up to 30 individuals of each species captured from the combined longline and gill net sets in the sampled bay. Fish were measured (TL, mm) and weighed (g) prior to removal of stomachs for dietary analyses. Stomach contents were analyzed in the laboratory to determine diet composition. Gut contents were sorted into gross taxonomic categories, enumerated and weighed (g). All fish prey items (fish tissue, otoliths and bones such as jaws, vertebrae, etc. as well as partially and fully intact fish prey) were shipped to a second laboratory. There fish were identified to species, estimated to size from hard parts based on published regressions, and counted.']",['Mary Anne Bishop'],['83746f58-885c-463a-abbf-d251bda37852'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Podothecus accipenserinus', 'sturgeon poacher', 'Nautichthys oculofasciatus', 'sailfin sculpin', 'Mallotus villosus', 'capelin, capelan', 'Isopsetta isolepis', 'butter sole', 'Myoxocephalus scorpius', 'shorthorn sculpin, chaboisseau Ã\xa0 Ã©pines courtes', 'Lepidopsetta polyxystra', 'northern rock sole', 'Thaleichthys pacificus', 'eulachon', 'Oncorhynchus tshawytscha', 'Chinook salmon, king salmon, saumon chinook, salmÃ³n boquinegra', 'Bathyraja aleutica', 'Aleutian skate', 'Bathyraja interrupta', 'Bering skate, sandpaper skate', 'Sebastes proriger', 'redstripe rockfish', 'Sebastes nigrocinctus', 'tiger rockfish', 'Reinhardtius stomias', 'arrowtooth flounder', 'Trichodon trichodon', 'Pacific sandfish', 'Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus', 'red Irish lord', 'Parophrys vetulus', 'English sole, platija limÃ³n', 'Hexagrammos lagocephalus', 'rock greenling', 'Triglops pingelii', 'ribbed sculpin', 'Squalus acanthias', 'piked dogfish, spiny dogfish, dogfish, grayfish, spurdog, aiguillat commun, galludo espinoso, cazÃ³n espinoso comÃºn', 'Sebastes melanops', 'black rockfish', 'Hemilepidotus jordani', 'yellow Irish lord', 'Anoplopoma fimbria', 'sablefish, bacalao negro', 'Hexagrammos stelleri', 'whitespotted greenling', 'Bathymaster signatus', 'searcher', 'Poroclinus rothrocki', 'whitebarred prickleback', 'Lumpenus sagitta', 'snake prickleback', 'Lepidopsetta bilineata', 'rock sole', 'Microgadus proximus', 'Pacific tomcod', 'Leptocottus armatus', 'Pacific staghorn sculpin, charrasco de astas', 'Sebastes emphaeus', 'Puget Sound rockfish', 'Ophiodon elongatus', 'lingcod, molva', 'Sebastes brevispinis', 'silvergray rockfish', 'Sebastes ruberrimus', 'rasphead rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, rocote ojo amarillo', 'Eleginus', 'saffron cod', 'Hippoglossus stenolepis', 'Pacific halibut, alabato del PacÃ\xadfico', 'Cryptacanthodes giganteus', 'giant wrymouth', 'Platichthys stellatus', 'starry flounder', 'Sebastes aleutianus', 'rougheye rockfish', 'Raja rhina', 'longnose skate, raya narigona', 'Hippoglossoides elassodon', 'flathead sole', 'Raja binoculata', 'big skate, raya bruja gigante', 'Limanda aspera', 'yellowfin sole', 'Sebastes maliger', 'quillback rockfish', 'Hexagrammos decagrammus', 'kelp greenling', 'Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus', 'great sculpin', 'Sebastes caurinus', 'copper rockfish, rocote cobrizo', 'Clupea pallasii', 'Pacific herring, arenque del PacÃ\xadfico', 'Gadus chalcogrammus', 'Walleye Pollock', 'Gadus macrocephalus', 'Pacific cod, morue du Pacifique, bacalao del Pacifico', 'bay', 'fjord', 'estuary', 'Prince William Sound', 'Exxon Valdez', 'oil spill', 'Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council', 'EVOSTC', 'EVOS Herring', 'EVOS Herring Survey', 'piscivory', 'food habits', 'top-down regulation', 'fish consumption', 'nursery bays', 'Pacific cod', 'walleye pollock', 'herring', 'diet diversity', 'diet analysis', 'predation', 'bioenergetics', 'March', 'November', 'OCEAN > PACIFIC OCEAN > NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN > GULF OF ALASKA', 'CONTINENT > NORTH AMERICA > UNITED STATES OF AMERICA > ALASKA']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/83746f58-885c-463a-abbf-d251bda37852'],[''],"['Fish Predation on Juvenile Herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 2009-2012, EVOS Prince William Sound Herring Program']"

"[""The principal objectives of this study were to analyze historical data on humpback whales (late 1970s to present) collected by research organization Eye of the Whale and others to develop time series of abundance for humpback whales in Prince William Sound. This historical data is proprietary and was not analyzed in depth. Annual high-quality surveys used photo-identification, so that numbers were counted accurately. In this work a relative index was also calculated from sightings and sampling effort but found to be of little value. Mark-recapture models were developed from the sighting histories to produce annual estimates of abundance. These estimates were then used in an age-structured assessment model of Pacific herring to estimate the historical effect of whale predation on herring.  The main result was that humpback whales constitute an important component of predation on Prince William Sound herring. The recovery of the Pacific herring population may be limited by this predation along with other factors. This project is an offshoot from Project 090804 and gives a 30 year perspective to the findings of that project. This study was graduate student Suzie Teerlink's master's thesis under the advisement of Dr. Terrance Quinn II, Professor of Fish Population Dynamics, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Juneau Center, School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences.

We will assess the significance of humpback whale predation on herring in PWS, particularly in winter. Specifically we will estimate the number of whales foraging in winter, determine when and if there is a prey switch to herring, and how long whales focus on herring as prey. Year one was funded, small in scale with an intense monitoring strategy; year 2 would expand the scale up in area significantly. Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed (and energy content consumed). Lastly, the estimated numbers of herring consumed would be included in an age-structured model so that the significance of whale predation on herring recovery can be evaluated. Year 4 (2010) will close out the project with the completion of analysis, reports, and manuscripts.

The snow-free season diminishes from low to high elevations. In response, the duration of the above-ground active season of the golden-mantled ground squirrel would be expected to decrease. The restriction of such a critical resource may have resulted in at least 2 sets of adaptive modifications.  1. The physiological control of the time of spring emergence and fall immergence in the annual cycle may have been adjusted to seasonal constraints. 2. Life history aspects, such as age of first reproduction, litter size, and survivorship, may have been altered by selection under different climatic regimes. The research reported here tested for the natural occurrence of these variations, whether they be genetically or merely phenotypically based. III. Within the subspecies Spermophilus lateralis chrysodeirus, (the researcher) tested for geographical and temporal variation in the schedule of springtime emergence, reproduction, and fall immergence. IV. This section describes variation in several demographic features of the golden-mantled ground squirrel, a hibernator, over a climatic gradient.']",['Michael Tyken Bronson'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.671.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek Basin', 'Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.671.1'],[''],['Altitudinal Variation in the Annual Cycle and Life History of the Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis)']

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or escape the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in or near freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. This dataset contains salmon escapement data extracted from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's OceanAK database, and contains data from multiple regions in Alaska.""]",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1VT1QB1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],[['escapement']],['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1VT1QB1'],[''],"['Daily salmon escapement counts from the OceanAK database, Alaska, 1921-2017']"

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: I examined the effect of flow and presence of large brown trout on habitat choice by juvenile rainbow trout and brook charr. Experiments were conducted in a large stream enclosure with a pool-riffle-pool configuration. Large brown trout, when present, were confined to the upstream pool. Juvenile trout and charr tended to leave the riffle and occupy the pools when flow was low. They also were less likely to be found in the upstream pool when large brown trout were present; juvenile fish remaining in the upstream pool avoided the deep area with cover favored by the large brown trout especially at sunset and at night at high flow.  Low flow apparently caused juvenile trout and charr to inhabit pools with large brown trout that they would otherwise avoid. Observations of marked individuals indicated that juvenile fish increased their preference for shallower water of intermediate velocity when flow changed from low to high, even after adjusting for different depth and velocity availabilities. This suggests that depth and velocity preferences were flow dependent. Furthermore, velocity choice of aggressive fish increased more than for non-aggressive individuals, and velocity choice of rainbow trout increased more than for brook charr. Feeding rates of juvenile rainbow trout and brook charr declined both when flow was low and when large brown trout were present, although aggressive fish had higher overall feeding rates than non-aggressive individuals. Feeding rates were likely affected by changes in food availability related to both flow level and changes in local fish density, as well as the aggressiveness of individual fish. This result indicates that microhabitats having water of the same velocity may not always be of the same value to drift-feeding juvenile salmonids. Overall, this study has shown that flow and predator effects on juvenile salmonid habitat choice are extremely complex.  Both habitat use and feeding rate were strongly  affected by flow, predator presence, diel period, and the aggressiveness level of individual fish. Interactions among these variables were common. Models used to recommend instream flows for regulated streams may not adequately evaluate stream fish habitat.']",['Elizabeth Ann Campbell'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.710.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Trout', 'Sagehen Creek', 'Habitat Preference']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.710.1'],[''],['Influence of Streamflow and Predators on Habitat Choice by Trout']

"['MASTERS THESIS: Age and growth studies of eastern brook, rainbow, and brown trout were conducted from samples collected in 1951 through 1954 in Sagehen Creek, a tributary of the Truckee River, in east-central California. There was a general increase in size in all species of trout in the downstream direction. The average lengths of untagged trout in four study sectionsÂ\x85 were compared. The eastern brook and rainbow trout grew at about the same rate; both, however, grew more slowly than the brown trout for the same section. The maximum growth for eastern brook trout occurred in the lower section with the average length decreasing both upstream and downstream from this area. Rainbow and brown trout both showed maximum growth in the lowest section from which samples were studied, with generally increasing size upstream. The differences in average size of the trout are best explained through influence of different water temperature upon physiological activity and on food consumption. In Sagehen Creek there is an increase of 13.8 degrees F in mean water temperatures from the upper to the lower sections. Each species of trout has an optimum temperature for growth which is reflected in the growth patterns between the different areas of the stream. The growth patterns of the eastern brook and brown trout demonstrate that the temperatures for maximum growth for eastern brook are lower than for brown trout. Population density affects growth through competition for food. There was no apparent correlation between the population density of all fishes of Sagehen Creek combined, and the growth rate of the troutÂ\x85Jaw-tagged eastern brook and rainbow trout grew more slowly than untagged fish of the same age, demonstrating that tagging in some manner is deleterious to growth. However, tagging had no apparent affect on the growth of brown trout. Examination of scales from 1953 sample demonstrated that rapid summer growth commenced about mid-June... Younger fish began growing sooner than older fish. There was no apparent difference in the time of commencement of summer growth in the various sections of the stream. Correlation of season growth patterns with the mean maximum and minimum water temperatures indicates that the summer growth period extends from mid-June to about October in Sagehen creek. Differences in average temperatures may extend or shorten the summer growth period by a few weeks in a given year. Both the eastern brook and rainbow trout of Sagehen Creek formed scales in their first summer of life; rainbow trout first forming scales at about 40mm in total lengthÂ\x85']",['Donald Wayne Seegrist'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.730.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek', 'Rainbow trout', 'Brook trout', 'Brown trout']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.730.1'],[''],"['Age and Growth of Trout in Sagehen Creek, California']"

"['Annual mean aboveground wood increments for both hardwood and softwood are provided for 1956 counties of the 28 eastern U.S. states on the basis of forest inventory data from 1960s to 1990s. Estimates of aboveground production and mortality of woody biomass for forests of the eastern United States were based on data collected from an extensive network of permanent inventory plots maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Estimates of growing stock volume by forest type and stand size-class were compiled for 1,956 counties in the 28 Eastern states on the basis of state-based inventories conducted between 1962 and 1988 and remeasurements conducted 6 to 23 years later, between 1985 and 1996 (with an average interval of 12 years) (see Brown and Schroeder 1999). Inventory data were aggregated by county into three broad forest categories (hardwood, pine, and spruce-fir) and three stand-size classes and expressed per unit area of forest land. Forest area is defined by the Forest Service as land producing, or capable of producing, in excess of 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial roundwood products. Stand volume was converted to aboveground biomass with regression equations for biomass expansion factors (BEF, ratio of aboveground biomass density of all living trees to merchantable volume). The change in biomass and mortality between the two inventories was converted to an average net annual change in growing stock and mortality (MWB, mortality of woody biomass). APWB (aboveground production of woody biomass) was calculated as the sum of net annual growth and mortality of woody biomass. APWB is a major component of aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Statistics were presented for hardwood and softwood (pine plus spruce-fir) forest categories. The approach accounted for production of commercial and noncommercial tree species with diameters greater than 2.5 cm and included noncommercial tree components (branches, twigs, and leaves) but did not account for annual leaf production. The estimation methods were based on work by Schroeder et al. 1997 and were also used to estimate woody biomass (Brown et al. 1999). The woody biomass data are archived at the ORNL DAAC as ""Woody Biomass for Eastern U.S. Forests, 1983-1996"" (Brown et al. 2003). \n\nBased on the analysis of the aboveground production data (Brown and Shroeder 1999), APWB for hardwood forests ranged from 0.6 to 28 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 5.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1. For softwood forests, APWB ranged from 0.2 to 31 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 4.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1. \n\nThe correct spatial patterns of woody production estimates were published in Brown and Schroeder (2000). The corrected version of Figure 2 from Brown and Schroeder (1999) is included here as a companion file. Aboveground production of woody biomass was generally highest in southeastern and southern counties, mostly along an arc from southern Virginia to Louisiana and eastern Texas. No clear spatial pattern of mortality of woody biomass (MWB) existed, except for a distinct area of high mortality in South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. For hardwood forests, MWB ranged from 0 to 15 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 1.1 Mg-1. The average MWB for softwood forests was 0.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1 with a range of 0 to 10 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The rate of MWB on an aboveground biomass basis averaged <1 percent/yr for both hardwood and softwood forests.']",['S. L.

Estimates of aboveground production and mortality of woody biomass for forests of the eastern United States were based on data collected from an extensive network of permanent inventory plots maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Estimates of growing stock volume by forest type and stand size-class were compiled for 1,956 counties in the 28 Eastern states on the basis of state-based inventories conducted between 1962 and 1988 and remeasurements conducted 6 to 23 years later, between 1985 and 1996 (with an average interval of 12 years) (see Brown and Schroeder 1999). Inventory data were aggregated by county into three broad forest categories (hardwood, pine, and spruce-fir) and three stand-size classes and expressed per unit area of forest land. Forest area is defined by the Forest Service as land producing, or capable of producing, in excess of 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial roundwood products. Stand volume was converted to aboveground biomass with regression equations for biomass expansion factors (BEF, ratio of aboveground biomass density of all living trees to merchantable volume). The change in biomass and mortality between the two inventories was converted to an average net annual change in growing stock and mortality (MWB, mortality of woody biomass). APWB (aboveground production of woody biomass) was calculated as the sum of net annual growth and mortality of woody biomass. APWB is a major component of aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Statistics were presented for hardwood and softwood (pine plus spruce-fir) forest categories. The approach accounted for production of commercial and noncommercial tree species with diameters greater than 2.5 cm and included noncommercial tree components (branches, twigs, and leaves) but did not account for annual leaf production. The estimation methods were based on work by Schroeder et al. 1997 and were also used to estimate woody biomass (Brown et al. 1999). The woody biomass data are archived at the ORNL DAAC as ""Woody Biomass for Eastern U.S. Forests, 1983-1996"" (Brown et al. 2003). \n\nBased on the analysis of the aboveground production data (Brown and Shroeder 1999), APWB for hardwood forests ranged from 0.6 to 28 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 5.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1. For softwood forests, APWB ranged from 0.2 to 31 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 4.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1. \n\nThe correct spatial patterns of woody production estimates were published in Brown and Schroeder (2000). The corrected version of Figure 2 from Brown and Schroeder (1999) is included here as a companion file. Aboveground production of woody biomass was generally highest in southeastern and southern counties, mostly along an arc from southern Virginia to Louisiana and eastern Texas. No clear spatial pattern of mortality of woody biomass (MWB) existed, except for a distinct area of high mortality in South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. For hardwood forests, MWB ranged from 0 to 15 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and averaged 1.1 Mg-1. The average MWB for softwood forests was 0.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1 with a range of 0 to 10 Mg ha-1 yr-1.

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or 'escape' the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. Some data about non-salmon species are also included. This dataset contains compiled data from a number of sources. The .Rmd merges all datasets, identifies and flags duplicate records, and performs quality assurance checks by filtering and graphing results.

['Phase shifts from scleractinian coral dominated reefs to algal dominated reefs have become increasingly abundant in the past few decades. These phase shifts cause increased interaction between coral and macroalgae. Coral- algal competition is of central importance to phase shifts on coral reef. This study set out to determine if the physical interactions between juvenile Porites lobata colonies and two coarse brown algae (Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum managarevense) affect coral-algal competition. It was found that Porites in the S.mangarevense treatment grew significantly less (36%) than coral in the Turbinaria treatment and controls.

"['These data represent energy use and fossil-fuel CO2 emissions associated with cropland production in the U.S. Energy use and emissions occurring on the farm are referred to as on-site energy and on-site emissions. Energy use and emissions associated with cropland production that occur off the farm (e.g., use of electricity, energy and emissions associated with fertilizer and pesticide production) are referred to as off-site energy and off-site emissions. The combination of on-site and off-site energy and carbon is referred to as total energy and total carbon, respectively. Maps of biomass density are critical inputs for estimating carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation of tropical forests. Brown and Gatson (1996) pioneered methods to use GIS analysis to map forest biomass based on forest inventory data (ndp055).

"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in westward and southeast Kodiak. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data file (ASL DATA EXPORT.csv), a reformatting script that reformats the original data file into a consistent format (ASL_Formatting_SoutheastKodiak.R), and the reformatted dataset as a .csv file (ASL_formatted_SoutheastKodiak.csv).']",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1SJ1HWB'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['age, sex, length']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1SJ1HWB'],[''],"['Salmon age, sex, and length data from Westward and Southeast Alaska, 1979-2017']"

"['Phytoplankton data through July 2007.  It\'s in a crosstab format (station and date down the side, with genus names across the top).  It\'s a fairly hefty dataset (about 5000 sampling events).  Genera that had less than 10 records for the entire dataset were eliminated.  ~ 90 genera total.  There are some samples where no phytoplankton were seen; in these cases you will see zeros across all the rows.  The values given are organisms per milliliter.  Station and genus metadata are included. \n\nA quick note about some of the taxa: we see a lot of benthic taxa in our samples because they become entrained in the water column.  Practically all our pennate diatoms are benthic.  The taxon ""unidentified flagellate"" is any flagellate thing we see that can\'t be identified (I think this is usually because they are not algae, but heterotrophic protists).  All of our algal flagellates (i.e. cryptomonads, flagellated green algae) are usually identified, unless they\'re too damaged.  I think this is rare, though; I think the majority of our algal flagellates can be identified, so very few would ever be called ""unidentified flagellate""  As for the class and common names, I\'ve gone off the most recent stuff that I have.  I don\'t particularly like calling a group of algae ""yellow-brown"" or ""yellow-green"" for 2 reasons: 1) frankly, it doesn\'t tell you much about the group, and 2) many taxa in different classes share pigments, and will have a similar color.  Something like ""haptophyte"" gives you a much better idea of where the alga belongs taxonomically.  Lastly, I\'ve used the term ""cyanobacteria"" instead of ""blue-green algae"" for a common name for the class Cyanophyceae.  I prefer the term ""cyanobacteria"" because they are the only group of algae that are prokaryotic.']",['Tiffany Brown'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nceas.915.6'],['TABULAR_DATA'],[''],['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnceas.915.6'],[''],['POD!

"['MASTERS THESIS: Willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) and yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) are both riparian-dependent neotropical migrant songbirds that have declined throughout much of their former range in California. Population declines have been primarily associated with the loss of riparian breeding habitat; increases in brood parasitism and nest predation have also contributed to declines and may be limiting population growth. IN this study, I determined the effect of potential nest predator activity on the nest success of both species, and identified potential willow flycatcher nest predators using yellow warbler nests as a surrogate. I used track plate transects, point counts, and time-constrained visual encounter surveys to assess potential mammalian, avian, and reptilian nest predator activity, respectively. I used simple linear regression and multiple linear regression analyses to determine the relationship between nest predator activity and nest success. Nest predation was the major cause of nest failure in both species. Only a small subset of the potential nest predator species detected in the meadows had activity indidices that were associated with the nest success of either species and include short-tailed weasel, Douglas squirrel, brown-headed cowbird, ClarkÂ\x92s nutcracker, and CooperÂ\x92s hawk. The magnitude of the effects of the different predator species on nest success varied depending on the prey species and the stage in the nesting cycle. Nest location relative to the forest edge and the amount of the meadow covered with water also influenced nest success. Short-tailed weasel, Douglas squirrel, lodgepole chipmunk, deer mouse and unidentified chipmunk species were photographed depredating yellow warbler nests baited with zebra finch eggs. Management recommendations include the active flooding of portions of the meadows to restrict meadow access to forest edge associated nest predators and habitat restoration in areas of meadows that avoid the creation of Â\x91ecological trapsÂ\x92 should be employed to insure the persistence of high quality breeding habitat for willow flycatchers and yellow warblers in the central Sierra Nevada.']",['James William Cain'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.714.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek Basin', 'Willow flycatcher', 'Yellow Warbler', 'Predation', 'Nest Success']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.714.1'],[''],"['Nest Success of the Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) and Willow Flycatchers (Epidonax traillii) in Relation to Predator Activity in Montane Meadows of the Central Sierra Nevada, CA.']"

"['The Nutrition Group is interested in crustacean nutrition with the majority of our research being focused on the lobster (Homarus americanus). One of the goals of the program is the development of an optimum nutrient profile for the lobster which will serve as a guideline for a commercial ration. Research is also conducted on defining other nutritional parameters, such as consumption, assimilation, and food conversion, which will be important to the commercial lobster aquaculturist. We have found that addition of a phospholipid (lecithin) to the diet of juvenile lobsters eliminates ""molt deaths,"" which were responsible for up to 70% of the juvenile lobsters that died when fed previous artificial diets. The specific component of lecithin which is essential, was found to be phosphatidylcholine, a compound which lobsters apparently cannot synthesize at a rate high enough to meet their physiological needs. The effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine in reducing mortality related to the molt death syndrome is dependent on the source of the compound. Phosphatidylcholine molecules which are comprised of long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids are the most effective. Further research has indicated the physiological role of phosphatidylcholine is related to the transport of cholesterol, an essential nutrient for lobsters as well as all other arthropods which are incapable of synthesizing this sterol. Although a basic outline has been developed as to the role of phospholipids in lobster nutrition, a number of detailed questions have yet to be answered as to optimum dietary levels of phospholipids and cholesterol, in order to maximize ration efficiency. Continuing studies will extend these findings, evaluate the effects of other dietary components, and test particular      diet mixes in long-term lobster growth experiments.      Two graduate students, Michele Bronstein and Karen Norman, are working under the direction of Dr. Conklin in the Nutrition group. Michele Bronstein, who joined the laboratory this summer, is a graduate student at UC Davis, being jointly sponsored by Dr. Duane Brown of the Food Science and Technology Department and by Dr. Conklin, is examining the role of Vitamin D metabolites on the physiology of fish. She is particularly interested in aspects of comparative physiology comparing a typical bony fish, the catfish, and the sturgeon, which although evolutionarily a bony fish, has reverted to the more primitive      cartilaginous skeleton. Michele has refined and optimized existing HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) techniques, specifically for analyses of Vitamin D metabolites in fish serum.      Karen Norman, a Ph.D. student in the Nutrition Graduate group at UC Davis, is investigating amino acid      metabolism in the lobster, Homarus americanus. Preliminary feeding trials have indicated that the amino      acid profile required by lobsters may be unique. Further investigations will allow for optimization of      protein quality in commercial lobster rations, and should help in the movement of lobster aquaculture from the lab to commercial reality.']",['Douglas Conklin'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.755.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['lobster', 'aquaculture', 'catfish', 'sturgeon']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.755.1'],[''],['Aquaculture: Nutrition/Feed Development']

Field data on shorebird ecology and environmental conditions were collected from 1993-2014 at 16 field sites in Alaska, Canada, and Russia.  Data were not collected in every year at all sites. Studies of the population ecology of these birds included nest-monitoring to determine timing of reproduction and reproductive success; live capture of birds to collect blood samples, feathers, and fecal samples for investigations of population structure and pathogens; banding of birds to determine annual survival rates; resighting of color-banded birds to determine space use and site fidelity; and use of light-sensitive geolocators to investigate migratory movements. Data on climatic conditions, prey abundance, and predators were also collected. Environmental data included weather stations that recorded daily climatic conditions, surveys of seasonal snowmelt, weekly sampling of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates that are prey of shorebirds, live trapping of small mammals (alternate prey for shorebird predators), and daily counts of potential predators (jaegers, falcons, foxes). Detailed field methods for each year are available in the ASDN_protocol_201X.pdf files.  All research was conducted under permits from relevant federal, state and university authorities.

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: A study of the effects of beaver on trout was conducted on Sagehen Creek, Nevada County, California, from 1954 to 1957. The purpose of the inquiry was to investigate several ways in which beaver and their activities influence the three species of trout present in the creek. Accordingly, comparisons were made between sections of the natural stream and sections that had been ponded by beaver, in regard to: 1. physico-chemical conditions; 2. production of trout foods; 3. feeding habits of the trout; and 4. populations of trout and other fish. Further, the consequences of beaver dam removal on trout foods and populations were assessed, as well as the ways beaver dams affect trout spawning activities. The physical environment of the trout was altered measurably following the construction of beaver dams as the substrate changed from gravel and rubble to silt, water velocities decreased, aquatic and riparian vegetations were changed and winter ice conditions became less severe. Also, the depth and area of the aquatic habitat increased. Water temperature extremes lessened in the ponds, but water chemistry was little affectedÂ\x85Although fewer different kinds of organisms were found to live in pond bottoms, much greater standing crops of bottom foods were living there than in the stream regardless of whether the comparisons were made on area or linear bases. Different bottom types were found to be decreasingly productive in terms of the bottom fauna in the following order: New beaver pond (most productive), old beaver pond, stream silt, rubble between beaver ponds, stream rubble and gravelÂ\x85All trout relied heavily on bottom faunas for food. In summer, however, drift organisms also became important. Trout living in the stream ate the stream fauna almost exclusively. Some pond trout were not as restricted in their feeding habits as rainbows living in the ponds depended largely on stream organisms for food. Pond brook and brown trout, on the other hand, were supported mainly by pond faunas. Foraging was not random; some organisms, though seemingly unavailable, were selected by trout in both habitats.  The higher productivity of bottom fauna and the unique physical environment in the ponds were reflected in greater trout populations, these in turn resulted in a higher angler catch than in the stream. Sculpin populations were larger in stream than in pond areas. It was pointed out that sculpins and trout affect one another in several ways, but the net result of this interaction is unknown. A destructive flood occurred in Sagehen Creek in 1955 and resulted in a decreased fish population throughout the entire creek. This flood also removed most of the beaver dams in the rockslide colonyÂ\x85Following dam removal, there was a substantial drop in the amount of trout food produced, and the tout populations dropped accordingly... The study concerned with the effects of beaver dams on trout spawning migrations indicatesÂ\x85that the dams are not complete barriers to trout migration It is likely that the dams are partial barriers to movement in the fall, as concentrations of trout were observed below some dams at that season. However, there is no evidence that the barrier influence of the dams depresses the level of adult trout populations. It is concluded that beaver are of decided benefit to trout in Sagehen creek, but that caution should be exercised in applying the data and conclusion for this creek to other areas.']",['Richard Gard'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.729.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek', 'Beaver', 'Trout']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.729.1'],[''],"['The Effects of Beaver on Trout in Sagehen Creek, California']"
"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. There is some data on non-salmon species (whitefish, sheefish, longnose sucker, Dolly Varden) in the Yukon dataset. There is an additional data table for more specific information about the locations where samples were collected. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area â\x80\x93 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.']",['Harvey Stuart'],['doi:10.5063/AA/hstuar01.6.3'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Zostera', 'Seagrass', 'Benthic', 'Epibenthic', 'Epifauna']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fhstuar01.6.3'],[''],"['Zostera Epifauna Beaufort, NC, USA']"
"[""Publications containing historical energy statistics make it possible to estimate fossil fuel CO2 emissions back to 1751. Etemad et al. (1991) published a summary compilation that tabulates coal, brown coal, peat, and crude oil production by nation and year. Footnotes in the Etemad et al.(1991) publication extend the energy statistics time series back to 1751. Summary compilations of fossil fuel trade were published by Mitchell (1983, 1992, 1993, 1995). Mitchell's work tabulates solid and liquid fuel imports and exports by nation and year. These pre-1950 production and trade data were digitized and CO2 emission calculations were made following the procedures discussed in Marland and Rotty (1984) and Boden et al. (1995). Further details on the contents and processing of the historical energy statistics are provided in Andres et al. (1999).\n\nThe 1950 to present CO2 emission estimates are derived primarily from energy statistics published by the United Nations (2017), using the methods of Marland and Rotty (1984). The energy statistics were compiled primarily from annual questionnaires distributed by the U.N. Statistical Office and supplemented by official national statistical publications. As stated in the introduction of the Statistical Yearbook, in a few cases, official sources are supplemented by other sources and estimates, where these have been subjected to professional scrutiny and debate and are consistent with other independent sources. Data from the U.S. Department of Interior's Geological Survey (USGS 2017) were used to estimate CO2 emitted during cement production. Values for emissions from gas flaring were derived primarily from U.N. data but were supplemented with data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (1994), Rotty (1974), and data provided by G. Marland. Greater details about these methods are provided in Marland and Rotty (1984), Boden et al. (1995), and Andres et al. (1999).\n\nSince 1751 just over 400 billion metric tonnes of carbon have been released to the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production. Half of these fossil-fuel CO2 emissions have occurred since the late 1980s. The 2014 global fossil-fuel carbon emission estimate, 9855 million metric tons of carbon, represents an all-time high and a 0.8% increase over 2013 emissions. The slight increase continues a three-year trend of modest annual growth under 2% per year. This modest growth comes on the heels of a quick recovery from the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis which had obvious short-term economic and energy use consequences, particularly in North America and Europe.\n\nGlobally, liquid and solid fuels accounted for 75.1% of the emissions from fossil-fuel burning and cement production in 2014. Combustion of gas fuels (e.g., natural gas) accounted for 18.5% (1823 million metric tons of carbon) of the total emissions from fossil fuels in 2014 and reflects a gradually increasing global utilization of natural gas. Emissions from cement production (568 million metric tons of carbon in 2014) have more than doubled in the last decade and now represent 5.8% of global CO2 releases from fossil-fuel burning and cement production. Gas flaring, which accounted for roughly 2% of global emissions during the 1970s, now accounts for less than 1% of global fossil-fuel releases.\nSince 1751 approximately 392 billion metric tonnes of carbon have been released to the atmosphere from the consumption of fossil fuels and cement production. Half of these fossil-fuel CO2 emissions have occurred since the mid 1980s. The 2013 global fossil-fuel carbon emission estimate, 9776 million metric tons of carbon, represents an all-time high and a 1.1% increase over 2012 emissions.  The increase continues a quick recovery from the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis which had obvious short-term economic and energy use consequences, particularly in North America and Europe.\n\nGlobally, liquid and solid fuels accounted for 75.2% of the emissions from fossil-fuel burning and cement production in 2013. Combustion of gas fuels (e.g., natural gas) accounted for 18.5% (1806 million metric tons of carbon) of the total emissions from fossil fuels in 2013 and reflects a gradually increasing global utilization of natural gas. Emissions from cement production (554 million metric tons of carbon in 2013) have more than doubled in the last decade and now represent 5.7% of global CO2 releases from fossil-fuel burning and cement production.

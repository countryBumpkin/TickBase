"['Tick-borne diseases are the most commonly reported vector-borne diseases in North America and recent estimates of Lyme disease prevalence in the United States alone are as high as 300,000 cases annually. While the vast majority of cases in the US are reported in the upper Midwest and northeast, there are cases reported from throughout California every year, yet research on ticks and the diseases they vector has been restricted primarily to a handful of northern California counties.\nRecent research has extended this work to Santa Barbara County and yielded results suggesting both that phenology of some tick species is remarkably constant over large geographic areas and that tick populations and communities can be highly variable even within relatively small geographic areas with similar habitats and climate. As a result, acaralogical risk is expected to be highly variable across the landscape.\nRecent large-scale studies and surveillance efforts have been undertaken in the eastern US to characterize this variability and identify areas of high expected acaralogical risk. This type of large-scale sampling effort on the ground is crucial to our understanding of the highly geographically variable nature of ticks and tick-borne diseases and what factors are driving their emergence.\nThis project aims to use the UC Natural Reserve System to carry out a standardized sampling and surveillance effort applied at a larger geographical scale than has yet been undertaken in California. The goal of which is both to begin to characterize regional differences in tick communities, infection prevalence, and human risk as well as provide baseline information for the UC Reserves, and for the safety of staff and researchers working on them, that can be built upon in future studies. Specifically, data collected from the reserves will be used to ask the following questions:\n1.\tHow do tick community composition and relative abundance differ regionally in California?\nH1: I. pacificus will make up a larger proportion of the community at higher latitudes and in cooler, wetter climates; the proportion will decrease as latitude decreases and as climate becomes hotter and drier where it will be dominated by Dermacentor spp.\nH2: Overall tick abundance will decrease with latitude and as climate becomes more arid.\n2.\tAre there differences in infection prevalence of I. pacificus with B. burgdorferi on a regional scale in California?\nH3: Infection prevalence will be highest in the north and decrease with latitude.']",['Andy MacDonald'],['nrs.874.3'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['tick-borne disease', 'Lyme disease', 'vector-borne diseases', 'acaralogical risk', 'regional differenes', 'tick communities', 'UC Reserves', 'Dermacentor spp.', 'I. pacificus', 'B. burgdorferi', 'Infection prevalence']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/nrs.874.3'],[''],"['Assessing regional differences in community composition, infection, prevalence, and human risk of tick-borne disease in California']"

"[""Brood tables, also called run reconstructions, utilize annual estimates of the total run (commercial catch plus escapement), and samples of ages, to estimate the number of recruits per age class. These data are useful for salmon biologists to understand salmon productivity and salmon life histories.

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: How does the golden-mantled ground squirrel contend with the severe restriction in time available for reproduction and growth? The answer may emerge from examination of the correlation between the length of the active season and other characteristics of the species. The snow-free season diminishes from low to high elevations. In response, the duration of the above-ground active season of the golden-mantled ground squirrel would be expected to decrease. The restriction of such a critical resource may have resulted in at least 2 sets of adaptive modifications.  1. The physiological control of the time of spring emergence and fall immergence in the annual cycle may have been adjusted to seasonal constraints. 2. Life history aspects, such as age of first reproduction, litter size, and survivorship, may have been altered by selection under different climatic regimes. The research reported here tested for the natural occurrence of these variations, whether they be genetically or merely phenotypically based. III. Within the subspecies Spermophilus lateralis chrysodeirus, (the researcher) tested for geographical and temporal variation in the schedule of springtime emergence, reproduction, and fall immergence. IV. This section describes variation in several demographic features of the golden-mantled ground squirrel, a hibernator, over a climatic gradient.']",['Michael Tyken Bronson'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.671.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek Basin', 'Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.671.1'],[''],['Altitudinal Variation in the Annual Cycle and Life History of the Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis)']

"['Although the geographic range is a fundamental unit of analysis for many macroecological and biogeographical studies, as a representation of the spatial distribution of individuals it is clearly a scale-dependent abstraction. As any amateur naturalist realizes, a species is not guaranteed to be present at every point within the range delimited by a field guide. Geographically extensive survey data such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) allow the characterization of distribution patterns within the geographic range. Using BBS data (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) paired with digital range maps from NatureServe (http://www.natureserve.org/getData/birdMaps.jsp), I calculated a simple measure of range occupancy for 298 species of North American birds.

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or escape the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in or near freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. This dataset contains salmon escapement data extracted from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's OceanAK database, and contains data from multiple regions in Alaska.""]",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1VT1QB1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],[['escapement']],['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1VT1QB1'],[''],"['Daily salmon escapement counts from the OceanAK database, Alaska, 1921-2017']"

"['Understanding species interactions and their effects on distributions is crucial for assessing the impacts of global change, particularly for invasive species. Co-occurrence models can help investigate these effects when interactions are likely given shared traits. For such an assemblage of invasive and native carnivorans, we examined how patterns of co-occurrence change across space and environmental gradients using a static multispecies occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detectability and models co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, and also extended it to be temporally dynamic. We focused on invasive raccoons, which pose threats to humans and wildlife globally. In Japan, raccoons prey on many native taxa, but little is known about interactions with sympatric carnivorans. We searched for signals of competitive exclusion of native raccoon dogs (tanuki) and invasive masked palm civets by applying the model to detection data from a broad-scale trapping effort over 6 years. Forest cover was the strongest predictor of occupancy for individual species and raccoon co-occurrences, and raccoon occupancy probability increased with forest cover conditionally depending on the co-occurring carnivoran: only tanuki absence or civet presence had positive responses. However, tanuki occupancy probability increased with forest cover despite any co-occurrence. Thus, we found no evidence of competitive exclusion by raccoons, contrary to our expectations. As parts of the world with invasive raccoons can also have invasive tanuki, our findings may have broad management implications. The model we present should be useful for inferring signals of biotic interactions between species with low detectability over multi-year time frames.']",['Jamie M.

For such an assemblage of invasive and native carnivorans, we examined how patterns of co-occurrence change across space and environmental gradients using a static multispecies occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detectability and models co-occurrence as a function of environmental variables, and also extended it to be temporally dynamic. We focused on invasive raccoons, which pose threats to humans and wildlife globally. In Japan, raccoons prey on many native taxa, but little is known about interactions with sympatric carnivorans. We searched for signals of competitive exclusion of native raccoon dogs (tanuki) and invasive masked palm civets by applying the model to detection data from a broad-scale trapping effort over 6 years. Forest cover was the strongest predictor of occupancy for individual species and raccoon co-occurrences, and raccoon occupancy probability increased with forest cover conditionally depending on the co-occurring carnivoran: only tanuki absence or civet presence had positive responses. However, tanuki occupancy probability increased with forest cover despite any co-occurrence. Thus, we found no evidence of competitive exclusion by raccoons, contrary to our expectations. As parts of the world with invasive raccoons can also have invasive tanuki, our findings may have broad management implications. The model we present should be useful for inferring signals of biotic interactions between species with low detectability over multi-year time frames.']",['Jamie M.

"['Human activities often lead natural systems to be nutrient enriched, with anthropogenically derived nutrients commonly delivered in discrete pulses.  Both nutrient enrichment and nutrient pulses can impact plant performance and phenotypic plasticity, especially in invasive species, but quantifying their independent effects remains challenging. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment and nutrient pulse magnitude, we established a common garden experiment using the North American wetland invader Phragmites australis and its native conspecific Phragmites australis subsp. americanus (five source populations each). We exposed plants to three levels of nutrient enrichment that were delivered either in small or large magnitude pulses, examining productivity and plasticity responses over a single growing season. Productivity and biomass allocation differed by lineage, with invasive Phragmites producing 73% more biomass and 66% more culms, but with the native growing 31% taller and allocating more of its biomass belowground.  Contrary to expectations, both lineages responded similarly to nutrient enrichment and were similarly plastic in their traits.  Nutrient enrichment, rather than nutrient pulses, led to large productivity gains and trait plasticity magnitudes.  However, total biomass and leaf-level traits (specific leaf area and chlorophyll concentration) were responsive to variation in nutrient pulse magnitudes. By decoupling the effects of nutrient enrichment from nutrient pulses, our study demonstrates the independent effects of these two key factors for plant performance and, by extension, invasion success.  We report trait-based similarities between two lineages of Phragmites that play contrasting ecological roles in North American wetlands, and we highlight the potentially detrimental effects of nutrient pulses.

"['The management of North American waterfowl is predicated on long-term, continental scale banding implemented prior to the hunting season (i.e., Julyâ\x80\x93September) and subsequent reporting of bands recovered by hunters. However, single-season banding and encounter operations have a number of characteristics that limit their application to estimating demographic rates and evaluating hypothesized limiting factors throughout the annual cycle. We designed and implemented a 2-season banding program for American black ducks, mallards, and hybrids in eastern North America to evaluate potential application to annual life cycle conservation and sport harvest management. We assessed model fit and compared estimates of annual survival among model types (i.e., 2-season and single season by banding season) to evaluate model assumptions and potential application to population modeling and management. Estimates of annual survival and patterns among age and sex cohorts using pre-season and 2-season models were similar to previously published results. We found patterns of seasonal survival varied by species, age, and to a lesser extent, sex. Our results suggest the 2-season model generally fits well with the most consistent lack of fit being due to black ducks in the post-season banded cohort. There was generally high agreement between annual survival estimates from the 2-season model and pre- and post-season data only model. Hunter recovered birds exhibited similar spatial distributions regardless of banding season suggested both banded samples were from the same population, though the Goodness-of-Fit test suggests this assumption was violated in some regions and years. We conclude the estimates of seasonal and annual survival for black ducks and mallards based on the 2-season banding program are valid and accurate based on model fit statistics, similarity in survival estimates across models, and similarities in the distribution of recoveries. The 2-season program provides greater precision and insight into the survival process and will improve the ability of researchers and managers to test competing hypotheses regarding population regulation resulting in more effective management.']",['Patrick Devers'],['urn:uuid:562c0b69-2d8a-4975-a719-18ce16d473f4'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['banding, black duck, encounter, mallard, survival2']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/urn%3Auuid%3A562c0b69-2d8a-4975-a719-18ce16d473f4'],[''],['Evaluation of a 2-season banding program to estimate seasonal and annual survival probabilities of migratory birds: a case study of American black ducks and eastern mallards.']

I. Study site and methods are described. II. Population structural differences are found between chipmunk populations in the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada. Litter size variation between species, and age specific fecundity of females within and between years are shown. Life table analyses are performed and life history and reproductive parameters are then compared to those of other chipmunk spc. Latitudinal trends are also analyzed. III. Ontogenetic and annual cyclic changes in reproductive state and weight will be analyzed for both sexes. The reproductive seasonal phenology of Eutamia sonomae will be compared to those of other species of Eutamias. Male reproductive strategies in Eutamias are proposed and the environmental and evolutionary regimes that have selected for these are discussed. Eutamias is then compared in its mating social system with other N.

"['The Broodstock Development and Genetics Group embraces a diversity of research projects on the population, evolutionary and aquacultural genetics of marine invertebrates. Principal activity funded by the      California Sea Grant Program is devoted to controlling the reproductive cycle of lobsters so that a large scale selective breeding program can develop in step with the commercial cultivation of this species.      A major breakthrough in this effort has been the discovery that ovarian development and egg extrusion are synchronized in groups of lobster females experiencing a transition from short day to long day photoperiods. Moreover, the conditions for and extent of mutual interference between growth and reproductive processes are now being documented. Since growth rate can be regulated by temperature and ovarian maturation by photoperiod, the implication of this research is clearly that it will be possible to control the entire life cycle of lobsters in captivity and manipulate reproductive cycles to yield seed for lobster farms on a year-round basis. Current research is aimed at better understanding the critical durations      of certain photoperiod-temperature regimes needed to complete the lengthy reproductive cycle of Homarus.      The European lobster (H. gammarus) frequently spawns annually in the laboratory, but most American lobsters (H. americanus) require about l8-20 months. Some exceptional annual spawnings by American lobsters have occurred, however, and we are hopeful of routinely shortening the cycle by photoperiod-temperature manipulation.      In the meantime hybridizations between the European and American species of lobsters continue to bear fruit. We are anxious to test the fertility of the hybrids as the next step in assessing what intrinsic reproductive incompatibility, if any, separates the two described species of Homarus. Many of these Fl hybrids are approaching maturity, have received broodstock ID numbers, and several have been mated. One Fl female matured earlier this year, was mated to an Fl hybrid male and extruded a complement of F2 hybrid embryos. These eggs were unfortunately lost, a problem also encountered with other broodstock: research on the causes of egg loss, including the role of diet, has begun.      Chemically mediated growth inhibition among juvenile lobsters has been discovered. An experiment has recently been completed on this growth inhibition as a function of flow rate through a linear array of compartments: the results should help discriminate between two alternatives, that the inhibitor is continuously produced or that it is intermittently secreted or excreted perhaps as a component of urine.      Other studies on the species specifically of the inhibition and the role of body size differences are      planned or in progress.      An electrophoretic study of abalone was completed for Sea Grant to assess the extent of genetic differences among isolated populations in view of planned hatchery release programs. Several protein      polymorphisms were found, but the frequencies of alleles did not differ dramatically among Channel Island and mainland localities.      A three-year study of genetic divergence among oysters of the Crassostrea virginica group was initiated with NSF support. A field trip in Mexico last March allowed collection of live oysters from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coasts. Electrophoretic analyses are currently being made.      A comprehensive review of all aspects of the genetics of crustaceans was completed for Academic PressÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99 forthcoming Biology of the Crustacea, Vol. l.

"[""As salmon migrate from the marine environment to freshwater streams to spawn, a certain number are allowed to pass through, or 'escape' the salmon fishery (frequently located near the mouth of the freshwater stream) as a management strategy to preserve the species. Escapement data are the enumeration of these migrating fish as they pass upstream, and represent an index of the total abundance of spawning salmon in that particular stream. These data are important for fisheries management, since most salmon harvest occurs in freshwater rivers during this migration. Escapement data are collected in a variety of ways. Stationary projects utilize observers stationed along freshwater corridors who count salmon as they pass upriver through weirs or past elevated towers. Sonar equipment placed in the river can also give a stationary escapement count. These counts usually represent a sample, and are expanded to represent a 24h period. Escapement data can also be collected using aerial surveys, where observers in an aircraft provide an index to estimate escapement. In general, escapement counts do not represent total abundance, but instead an index of abundance. Surveys are usually timed to coincide with peak spawning activity, generally in the summer, but in the case of Coho salmon in the fall as well. Some data about non-salmon species are also included. This dataset contains compiled data from a number of sources. The .Rmd merges all datasets, identifies and flags duplicate records, and performs quality assurance checks by filtering and graphing results.

"['Alaska encompasses several climate types because of its vast size, high-latitude location, proximity to oceans, and complex topography. There is a great need to understand how climate varies regionally for climatic research and forecasting applications. Although climate-type zones have been established for Alaska on the basis of sea- sonal climatological mean behavior, there has been little attempt to construct climate divisions that identify regions with consistently homogeneous climatic variability. In this study, cluster analysis was applied to monthly-average temperature data from 1977 to 2010 at a robust set of weather stations to develop climate divisions for the state. Mean-adjusted Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer surface temperature estimates were employed to fill in missing temperature data when possible. Thirteen climate divisions were identified on the basis of the cluster analysis and were subsequently refined using local expert knowledge. Divisional boundary lines were drawn that encompass the grouped stations by following major surrounding topographic boundaries. Correlation analysis between station and gridded downscaled temperature and precipitation data supported the division placement and boundaries. The new divisions north of the Alaska Range were the North Slope, West Coast, Central Interior, Northeast Interior, and Northwest Interior. Divisions south of the Alaska Range were Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Aleutians, Northeast Gulf, Northwest Gulf, North Panhandle, Central Panhandle, and South Panhandle. Correlations with various Pacific Ocean and Arctic climatic teleconnection indices showed numerous significant relationships between seasonal division average temperature and the Arctic Oscillation, Pacificâ\x80\x93North American pattern, North Pacific index, and Pacific decadal oscillation.']",[''],['dcx_fa0cd520-c553-4ff9-90f9-cfe3d0176d7e_0'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['climate dividions', 'climate variability', 'Alaska']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/dcx_fa0cd520-c553-4ff9-90f9-cfe3d0176d7e_0'],[''],['Climate Divisions for Alaska Based on Objective Methods']
"['The contribution of small Canadian Arctic rivers to the total freshwater flux through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is unknown and remains a significant gap in the growing data set addressing the freshwater budget of the Arctic and subarctic oceans. Limited geochemical data have been collected from the CAA, Nares Strait, and Baffin Bay, and the existing data sets are too sparse to differentiate among the various freshwater sources thought to contribute to the total freshwater pool (i.e., Pacific water, sea-ice meltwater, and meteoric water derived from the Mackenzie River, Eurasian rivers, and local runoff). New programs have begun to collect requisite geochemical data in Davis Strait and other regions. However, interpretation of these measurements may be biased by typical endmember assignments associated with Eurasian and North American river runoff. Characterizing the geochemical signature of local freshwater inputs is essential for distinguishing these contributions from those of Arctic Ocean origin, but virtually no studies have sampled small Arctic rivers discharging into the CAA. Available data collected from Baffin Bay and Hudson Strait suggest local rivers do not resemble the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers typically assumed to represent North American runoff. While the annual discharge of any given river is relatively small, the combined discharge of all rivers is sufficient to support nearshore, narrow boundary currents, which provide an important, but often neglected, transport mechanism. Thus, local contributions of freshwater may impact the total volume flux and geochemistry of the Canadian Arctic throughflow that has historically been attributed entirely to export from the Arctic Ocean. The project consists of a three-year study to characterize the total alkalinity, barium, DOC, major ion and isotope (Î´18O, 87Sr/86Sr) geochemistry of remote CAA rivers and estuaries with the ultimate aim of resolving the contribution of local freshwater inputs to CAA boundary currents. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but emphasize the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The study focuses on eight rivers: the Coppermine, Ellice, Back, Hayes, Kuujuua, Thomsen, Cunningham, and Clyde Rivers. During summer field seasons of 2014-2016, four researchers are transported to each site via Twin Otter aircraft. Field operations begin at Kugluktuk (Coppermine River) in early July 2014 (river sampling only) and in early August of 2015 and 2016 (river and estuary sampling). Researchers spend 3-5 days at each site. The team utilizes airports located at Kugluktuk, Clyde River, and Ulukhaktok. More remote sites near the Thomsen, Ellice, Cunningham, and Back Rivers are accessed via equipping the Twin Otter with tundra tires. River water samples are collected by wading into the river and using an extendable pole to collect bulk (1L) samples from the central current. Bulk samples are then immediately filtered using a peristaltic pump and small subsamples are collected. Weekly samples are also collected by local workers in the more populated regions surrounding the Coppermine and Clyde Rivers to gain insight into the changes in river chemistry over the course of the spring and summer flow periods. Samples are collected from estuaries adjoining the river mouths from small, inflatable boats and a peristaltic pump equipped with multiple lengths of C-FLEX tubing.']",['Matthew Alkire'],['doi:10.18739/A2CP8H'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN CHEMISTRY > MARINE GEOCHEMISTRY', 'EARTH SCIENCE > CLIMATE INDICATORS > ATMOSPHERIC/OCEAN INDICATORS > FRESH WATER RIVER DISCHARGE', 'EARTH SCIENCE > OCEANS > OCEAN CIRCULATION > FRESH WATER FLUX', 'EARTH SCIENCE > TERRESTRIAL HYDROSPHERE > SURFACE WATER > RIVERS/STREAMS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > CHEMICAL METERS/ANALYZERS > PH METERS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > CONDUCTIVITY SENSORS > CONDUCTIVITY METERS', 'IN SITU/LABORATORY INSTRUMENTS > SAMPLERS > BOTTLES/FLASKS/JARS > WATER BOTTLES', 'AIRCRAFT', 'STATION', 'POINT', 'MONTHLY TO ANNUAL', 'inlandWaters', 'oceans']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2CP8H'],[''],['Small Canadian Arctic River Flows']

"[""The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data packages includes data collected as part of Dale Wrubleski's PhD, as part of the invertebrates section of MERP.\n\tThis study examined chironomid responses to the flooding of ten drained experimental marshes in Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. Emergence traps were used to monitor chironomid emergence from three vegetation types (Symphyotrichum ciliatum, Scolochloa festucacea, and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) flooded at two water depths (shallow: 20-40 cm, deep: 50-70 cm) over a four-year period. Note that Dale Wrubleski's chironomid files are directly connected to the regular emergence trap sampling as part of the long-term monitoring program for invertebrates for MERP (stored in a separate data package on the KNB), and these counts are not independant of chironomid counts for the long-term sampling. This file only provides further classification of chironomid family/subfamily counts  to species level, in addition to total biomass for each species, in a subsample of the cover types and sample sites monitored for the long-term invertebrate monitoring program.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in westward and southeast Kodiak. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Age is recorded in European Notation, which is a method of recording both fresh and saltwater annuli. For example, for a fish that spent one year in freshwater and 3 years in saltwater, its age is recorded as 1.3. The total fish age is the sum of the first and second numbers, plus one to account for the time between deposition and emergence. Therefore the fish in this example is 5 years old. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data file (ASL DATA EXPORT.csv), a reformatting script that reformats the original data file into a consistent format (ASL_Formatting_SoutheastKodiak.R), and the reformatted dataset as a .csv file (ASL_formatted_SoutheastKodiak.csv).']",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1SJ1HWB'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['age, sex, length']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1SJ1HWB'],[''],"['Salmon age, sex, and length data from Westward and Southeast Alaska, 1979-2017']"

"['NCEAS-1998-2244-NonDist-Dataset: The NCEAS Community\n        Dynamics Working Group brought together theoretical and\n        empirical ecologists to evaluate the relative importance of\n        intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability in natural\n        communities. We focused on zooplankton community dynamics, in\n        part because we had access to extensive time series data on\n        zooplankton community structure from 35 North American lakes.\n        Thirty-four of the lakes were concentrated at 5 sites: the North\n        Temperate Lakes LTER site in Wisconsin; the University of Notre\n        Dame Environmental Research Center in Michigan; the Dorset\n        Environmental Research Centre, the Experimental Lakes Area, and\n        the Sudbury region, all in Ontario. We also have data for saline\n        Mono Lake in California. Our database has many strengths,\n        including the length of the time series (5-21 years); consistent\n        sampling methodologies, particularly for zooplankton; and the\n        availability of information on environmental factors, including\n        phytoplankton, physical parameters, and water chemistry. Another\n        unique aspect of our dataset is that it includes data from both\n        undisturbed reference lakes and experimentally manipulated\n        lakes. The whole-lake experiments include food web\n        manipulations, nutrient enrichments, acidifications and limings,\n        and an unplanned invasion of an exotic species. Some of the\n        experimental manipulations are even replicated within and among\n        sites, providing a unique opportunity to explore the extent to\n        which responses to a particular perturbation are consistent\n        across lakes. In addition to determining how manipulations\n        change the dynamics of zooplankton communities, we are using the\n        data from the reference lakes to establish bounds on normal ranges of variability and to explore how this variability differs among lakes at a site vs. between sites. Thus, our joint database is facilitating extensive comparisons of zooplankton community dynamics at the scale of whole lakes.']",['Anthony Ives'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nceas.19.9'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['North America', 'limnology', 'lakes', 'zooplankton', 'time series data']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnceas.19.9'],[''],"['Insights on community dynamics from large-scale, long-term      data: time series for zooplankton and environmental variates from      35 North American lakes']"
"['Many parasites and parasitoids are able to manipulate the behavior of their hosts for their own benefit. Parasites are also known to select their hosts based on certain physical characteristics, such as body size, that optimize their own fitness. Conopid fly larvae (Conopidae: Diptera) are endoparasitoids of bumblebees in Europe and North America. Previous research on the interaction between conopid flies and a single European bumblebee host species, Bombus terrestris, demonstrated that bees infected with a conopid larva would bury themselves in soil just prior to death, and that this behavior may confer fitness benefits on the conopid developing within the bee.  Additionally, it has been shown in several studies out of Europe and Canada that conopids are found more frequently in bees that are larger-bodied, a host characteristic that correlates positively with at least two measures of fitness: conopid pupal weight and adult fly emergence. This study, which took place at Blandy Experimental Farm in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, found that three locally common bumblebee species (B. bimaulatus, B. griseocollis, and B. impatiens) exhibit a digging behavior in response to parasitism by conopid larvae. Unexpectedly, one species, B. griseocollis, experienced a significantly lower rate of detected parasitism than the other two species.  I hypothesize that this may be due to reduced survivorship of larva within this host species. In accordance with previous research, this study also found that the likelihood of being parasitized increased with host body size, and that larger conopid pupae developed in larger-bodied bees. The findings of this research are novel: this study documents a parasite-induced modification of bumble bee behavior previously not observed in North American bumblebees and identifies one host species that may possess an ability to resist developing parasites. Further, this study sheds additional light on conopid-bumblebee host selection dynamics.']",['Staige Davis'],['Blandy.25.2'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Conopid', 'Parasitism', 'Digging Behavior', 'Behavior Manipulation', 'Bombus', 'Shenandoah Valley']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/Blandy.25.2'],[''],"['Bumble Bees and Parasitoid Flies: Manipulation of Host Behavior and the Importance of Host Body Size, Blandy Experimental Farm, Boyce, VA, 2012']"

"['In the ALE/GAGE/AGAGE global network program, continuous high frequency gas chromatographic measurements of four biogenic/anthropogenic gases (methane, CH4; nitrous oxide, N2O; hydrogen, H2; and carbon monoxide, CO) and several anthropogenic gases that contribute to stratospheric ozone destruction and/or to the greenhouse effect have been carried out at five globally distributed sites for several years. The program, which began in 1978, is divided into three parts associated with three changes in instrumentation: the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE), which used Hewlett Packard HP5840 gas chromatographs; the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE), which used HP5880 gas chromatographs; and the present Advanced GAGE (AGAGE). AGAGE uses two types of instruments: a gas chromatograph with multiple detectors (GC-MD), and a gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric analysis (GC-MS). Beginning in January 2004, an improved cryogenic preconcentration system (Medusa) replaced the absorption-desorption module in the GC-MS systems at Mace Head and Cape Grim; this provided improved capability to measure a broader range of volatile perfluorocarbons with high global warming potentials. The Medusa GC-MS systems were subsequently used at other AGAGE stations (Trinidad Head, Barbados, American Samoa, Zeppelin, Jungfraujoch, and Goan) after the initial setup at Mace Head and Cape Grim.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes artificial substrate data, collected as part of the invertebrate section of MERP.\n\tInvertebrate monitoring during the Marsh Ecology Research Project (MERP) has explored the effects of short- and long-term water level and associated vegetation changes on invertebrate populations. This project has produced an extensive and multi-faceted data set depicting the distribution and variation of invertebrates within a prairie wetland in flux. Artificial substrates were placed at each sampling station at the beginning of the sampling season to provide an index to Gastropodinae and Chironomidae populations colonizing submersed surfaces.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Although amphibians perform key roles in their ecosystems and contribute significantly to biodiversity, especially in tropical habitats, they are frequently excluded from conservation analyses because of a lack of information about their conservation status and distribution. To enhance our knowledge about amphibians and their conservation needs, three organizationsâ\x80\x94the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International, the Species Survival Commission of IUCNâ\x80\x93World Conservation Union, and NatureServeâ\x80\x94launched the Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA) in 2001. The results, published in 2004, represent the first-ever comprehensive status assessment of the world\'s 5,743 known amphibian species. This project represents the first time that all amphibians have been assessed against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and as such is an important contribution to the Red List Programme. More than 500 scientists from 60 countries contributed to the three-year study.\n\nThe GAA produced digital distribution maps for all but 101 of described amphibian species worldwide. The localities for unmapped species, generally including those described more than a century ago, are too vague to permit accurate mapping. NatureServe converted these maps to a format similar to that used for the digital range maps of the birds and mammals of the Western Hemisphere. Ranges are annotated to indicate where species are extant, extirpated, and introduced. In addition, NatureServe has updated dozens of maps of North American species subsequent to the original publication of the GAA.\n\nHere we make these maps available as a free resource for conservationists, researchers, and the general public. To view the map for each species, visit either our InfoNatura or Explorer websites, or the GAA website, search for the species you are interested in, and click on ""Range Map."" To download the map files in ArcView format, see below. The map files can be viewed using ESRI ArcExplorer software, which can be downloaded for free from ESRI\'s website.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands. This data package includes activity trap data, collected as part of the invertebrate section of MERP.\n\tInvertebrate monitoring during the Marsh Ecology Research Project (MERP) has explored the effects of short- and long-term water level and associated vegetation changes on invertebrate populations. This project has produced an extensive and multi-faceted data set depicting the distribution and variation of invertebrates within a prairie wetland in flux. Invertebrate sampling occurred in the controlled MERP cells on the Delta Marsh. Sampling stations within each cell were stratified based on dominant vegetation cover in order to increase sampling efficiency, as this reflects bottom contours. Activity traps were used at sites with standing water to provide an index of free-swimming invertebrates (Murkin et al. 1983).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., P.G.

"['DOCTORATE DISSERTATION:Increased land development and air pollution are intensifying nitrogen inputs to aquatic ecosystems of the American mountainous west. As a result, the health of mountain lakes and streams are at risk. Recognition of riparian zones as important modulators of stream water chemistry and critical habitat has increased interest in riparian management and restoration. Riparian classifications that reflect differences in ecosystem function can be used to prioritize management and restoration efforts and to develop landscape models of ecological processes. I examined structural and floristic variation in riparian zones of Lake Tahoe Basin and developed an ecosystem type classification for the area. I used this classification to test the hypothesis that ecosystem types can be used to organize the riparian landscape into areas with similar N dynamic and water quality effects. The greatest degree of structural and floristic variation in riparian zones of the Tahoe Basin fell along a gradient of valley form and stream sinuosity. I identified 12 ecosystem types along that gradient and examined N dynamics in five of the 12 types. During 1998 and 1999, I applied N fertilizer to plots representative of these five ecosystem types in a split-plot design. I measured soil N transformations, groundwater chemistry and site factors expected to control N dynamics in each plot. I found significant differences among ecosystem types in N process rates under background conditions. Differences in denitrification were most highly correlated to soil moisture content and groundwater level, while differences in net nitrification were most highly correlated to soil redox. Three ecosystem types had indistinguishably high denitrification responses to added N, whereas the denitrification response of another type was significantly lower than the rest. Groundwater N flux also varied significantly among types under N fertilized conditions: alder-rich ecosystem types had the highest, and grass-meadow ecosystem types had the lowest, groundwater N flux. Results from this research reveal the large structural and functional differences that exist among mountain riparian ecosystem types. These results also suggest that classification of riparian zones into ecosystem types may be useful in predicting landscape scale patterns of riparian zone N dynamics and water quality effects']",['Amy Goodenough Merrill'],['doi:10.5063/AA/nrs.715.1'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['Sagehen Creek', 'Riparian', 'Nitrogen Dynamics', 'Lake Tahoe Watershed']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FAA%2Fnrs.715.1'],[''],['Variation in the Structure and Nitrogen Dynamics of Mountain Riparian Zones']

"['Study History: Project 320-H received funding in 5 consecutive fiscal years beginning in FY 94 and concluding in FY 98 to investigate the role of zooplankton in processes influencing the survival of juvenile pink salmon and herring; FY 99 was designated a close-out year. Project H was a core component of the larger Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program. Zooplankton serves as food for many fish, bird and marine mammal stocks. SEA investigated its role as forage for juvenile fishes including pink salmon and herring, and also as alternative prey for predators that also consume juvenile pink salmon and herring in seasonally varying complex food webs. Previous annual reports of project 320-H appear in the integrated SEA report series for FY 94, FY 95, FY 96 and FY 97.

Species distribution shifts in response to climate change require that recruitment increase beyond current range boundaries. For trees with long lifespans, the importance of climate-sensitive seedling establishment to the pace of range shifts has not been demonstrated quantitatively. 2. Using spatially explicit, stochastic population models combined with data from long-term forest surveys, we explored whether the climate-sensitivity of recruitment observed in climate manipulation experiments was sufficient to alter populations and elevation ranges of two widely distributed, high-elevation North American conifers. 3. Empirically observed, warming-driven declines in recruitment led to rapid modeled population declines at the low-elevation, â\x80\x9cwarm edgeâ\x80\x9d of subalpine forest and slow emergence of populations beyond the high-elevation, â\x80\x9ccool edgeâ\x80\x9d. Because population declines in the forest occurred much faster than population emergence in the alpine, we observed range contraction for both species. For Engelmann spruce, this contraction was permanent over the modeled time horizon, even in the presence of increased moisture. For limber pine, lower sensitivity to warming may facilitate persistence at low elevations â\x80\x93 especially in the presence of increased moisture â\x80\x93 and rapid establishment above treeline, and, ultimately, expansion into the alpine. 4. Synthesis. Assuming 21st century warming and no additional moisture, population dynamics in high-elevation forests led to transient range contractions for limber pine and potentially permanent range contractions for Engelmann spruce. Thus, limitations to seedling recruitment with warming can constrain the pace of subalpine tree range shifts.""]",['Erin Conlisk'],['ess-dive-0d4c46200485654-20201209T025024468'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['EARTH SCIENCE > BIOSPHERE > ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS', 'EARTH SCIENCE > BIOSPHERE > VEGETATION', 'climate change', 'conifer', 'demographic model', 'range shift', 'subalpine forest', 'time-lag', 'tree line', 'Picea engelmannii Parry ex.

"[""In 1980-8l, I participated in the following research projects at BML.      1. Transport of Amino Acids by Nemertean Worms      In collaboration with G.C. Stephens  (U.C. Irvine), L.M. Crowe,  (U.C. Davis), I have been involved in studies on uptake of amino acids by juvenile nemertean worms found on Dungeness crabs. We have shown that the water found in the joints of the legs, where the worms are also found, contains high concentrations of primary amines.  We have identified these primary amines as amino acids, and have shown that the worms are capable of removing the amino acids from solution.  We have also shown that the source of these amino acids is almost certainly the crabs: using isolated pieces of arthrodial membrane mounted in a miniature Ussing chamber, we have shown that amino acids found in the blood of the crabs can leak across these membranes.  This work produced two publications and a paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in December 1980.      2. Divalent Cations and Membrane Permeability      In collaboration with J.S. Swinehart (U.C. Davis) I have participated in studies on effects of divalent cations on permeability of membranes of bivalve molluscs. We have shown that deletion of Ca   from the medium results in an efflux of amino acids from gills of Mytilus californianus, while Mg   seems to be required for the influx of amino acids into the same tissue.  In addition, we have shown that certain cations such as Ca  , known to have toxic effects on these organisms, stimulates an efflux of amino acids. We suggest that Ca   may displace Ca   bound to the cell membrane, and have provided some evidence to that effect already in our first publication on this subject (Swinehart et al., 1980. J. Exp. Zool.).  Dr. Swinehart presented some of this work at the ASZ meeting in December.     3. Freezing Tolerance of Marine Organisms      In collaboration with L.M. Crowe and S.J. O'Dell (U.C. Davis) I have been involved in studies on freezing of intertidal limpets and cysts of Artemia.  We have shown that limpets collected at Bodega Bay are capable of surviving freezing, with lethal temperatures well below  -lOoC. We have also shown that the lethal temperature may be altered by elevating the [Ca  ] in the blood.  We suspect that this Ca   effect may be related to Ca   binding to cell membranes in these animals, and we are presently investigating this possibility.  One paper on this subject has already been submitted for publication  (OÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99Dall and Crowe, 1980. Cryobiology, Submitted).  Mr. OÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99Dell presented a paper on part of the work at the annual meetings of the Society of Cryobiology in Victoria, B.C. (August 1980).      In the work on Artemia, we have found that cysts survive freezing in liquid nitrogen, provided that their water content is less than 0.6 g H2O/g dry weight.  Thermal analysis showed that the cysts contain 0.6 g unfreezable H2O/g dry weight, so ice is not formed in the animals until higher H2O contents are reached.  This work has been submitted for publication  (Crowe et al., 1980.  Cryobiology.  Submitted), and I presented a paper on the same subject at the annual meeting of the society of Cryobiology in Victoria, B.C. (August 1980).       4.  Other Projects      Our main research efforts are conducted at Davis, where we carry out studies on hydration dependent phase changes in membranes.  While almost none of this work is done at BML, we do use the lab for writing and some minor experimentation, and thus acknowledge the BML on these papers as well as those mentioned above.""]",['John H.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes staff gauge data collected on th experimental cells, as part of MERP.\n\nStudies of marsh ecosystems are frequently hampered by inadequate information about water budgets (Carter et al., 1979). Marshes are often open systems, particularly with respect to movement of water and associated particulate and dissolved materials (Kadlec, 1983). Efforts to evaluate the plant-nutrient relationships in such systems are contingent on knowledge of the hydrology of the system (Kadlec, 1979). Accurate estimates of water budgets are also essential pre-requisites for studies of wetland ecosystem nutrient cycles. Hence, the objective of the measurements described below, together with weather and water level/volume data, was to provide water budgets for nutrient budget calculations for the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP; Kadlec, 1989). The approach to hydrology used was the concept of mass balance:\n\nInputs - Outputs = change in volume\n\nFor this approach, all 3 terms had to be estimated. Change in volume was calculated from daily records of water level and water level - volume tables. Inputs of water to diked cells can be in 3 forms: precipitation, water pumped to maintain design levels, and seepage through the dike or sand ridge forming the north end of the cells. Precipitation inputs were calculated from weather records and pumping was metered, providing direct measurement. Seepage was estimated by difference, with checks based on groundwater topography and hydraulic conductivity, as well as seepage meter spot checks. Outputs of water were evapotranspiration, pumping, and seepage. Seepage out was derived primarily by difference. Because the hydrologic characteristics of different cells in different years were replicated, estimates of the standard error in the seasonal water budgets were possible and proved to be 10% or less (Kadlec, 1989).\n\nNote that precipitation, pumping, evaporation, groundwater level and hydraulic conductivity data for MERP are contained in separate data packages on the KNB.\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences: \nCarter, V., M.S.

This data set includes aboveground macrophyte production (MAG; 1980-1989) data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Both clip plot (MAGs; contained in a separate data package on the KNB) and turn-over plot (TOPs) methods were used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). As a single harvesting method would underestimate net primary productivity, turnover plots were used to correct the data. \n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

"['Age, sex and length data provide population dynamics information that can indicate how populations trends occur and may be changing. These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. There is some data on non-salmon species (whitefish, sheefish, longnose sucker, Dolly Varden) in the Yukon dataset. There is an additional data table for more specific information about the locations where samples were collected. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data files, reformatting scripts that reformat the original data files into a consistent format, and the reformatted datasets.']",[''],['doi:10.5063/F1K64GBK'],['TABULAR_DATA'],"[['age, sex, length']]",['https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/resolve/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1K64GBK'],[''],"['Salmon age, sex, and length data from Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Region of Alaska, 1960-2017']"
"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present.

A mitigating factor is that the land usage in the surrounding upland areas is much less intense and high quality water from this part of the landscape drains downslope as surface water but once it reaches the valley floor seeps into the outwash and joins (mixes with?) the recharge water from the intensively used valley floor.\n\nIn 1974 a water quality monitoring network was established on and near the Cornell Teaching and Research Center near Harford NY.  This is an ideal location to study the effect of farming (mostly dairy) on the nitrate and phosphorus in streams and aquifers in a typical outwash valley with its surrounding upland areas. First, a major ground water divide runs through the center of the farm; part draining to Fall Creek and the other to the Susquehanna River. This means that we know where all of the water originates. Secondly, Cornell University owns the land except for some upland areas that so far (2007) are mostly wooded/abandoned agricultural land. This simplifies access, information on usage and in some cases control management.\n\nThe objectives were a) to monitor behavior of aquifers in the gravel outwash and b) monitor water quality in the aquifers and surrounding uplands.\n\nIn 1974 a cooperative program was developed between Cornell University and the USGS. In early 1974 Allan Randall of the USGS guided the location and instillation of 8 monitoring wells. Following the initial 8 wells, additional shallow wells were installed.

During this period about 40% of the recharge to the aquifers was derived from precipitation on the area over the aquifers and 60% runoff from the uplands. Ground-water discharged down-valley as underflow about equaled recharge during this period.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Ã\x82Âº07'S, Long. 139Ã\x82Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons.

The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush).

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records.

To study the effects of grazing on these seedlings outside the reserve, three populations were identified and measured to the north of the fence, and a fourth population just south of the fence, i.e. on the reserve. Different fencing treatments were applied to the plants outside the reserve fence. One was protected from sheep, the second from both sheep and rabbits, the third left unprotected.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration. The resulting long-term vegetation monitoring project at Koonamore is now over 80 years old, making it one of the longest-running monitoring series of its type in the world.; Reserve History: In the mid 1920's Professor TGB Osborn and his colleagues extended their interests in ecology and field physiology of vegetation to the arid zone of South Australia. In 1892 Dixon had warned the Royal Society of South Australia of serious degradation of the soils and vegetation resulting from pastoralism and other alien influences in the region. Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Âº07'S, Long. 139Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons. Several species of Senna, Eremophila and other shrubs also occur.; Monitoring activities: Some or all of the following monitoring activities are carried out during visits to the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve: Vegetation Quadrats, Photopoints, Senna Quadrat (Cassia Corner), Myoporum platycarpum Plants, Saltbush Transects, Senna Populations, Kangaroo Transects, Rabbit Activity Monitoring and Control.; Kangaroo Transects: Many very young Senna seedlings were identified close to the Northern boundary of the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve, both inside and outside of the reserve in 1997.

Equally important to the origin of KVR was the new theory of vegetation succession derived from North American work early in the century. Osborn was particularly concerned with the question as to whether overgrazing by domestic and feral herbivores would result in return of the original vegetation via recognisable 'seral' stages, or whether the changes were ?artificial, mere destructions and as such outside the ecologist's proper field?. Although the concepts of 'succession' and the scope of ecology have developed and changed much since that time, nevertheless it was interest in 'succession to climax' that gave the initial impetus to KVR and many other long-term vegetation studies from that time. The theory of vegetation succession gave rise to the permanent charted quadrat as a technique for observing vegetation change. An extensive series of permanent quadrats was set up on KVR and supplemented by a series of fixed photopoints, in order to pursue the first aim. Although some of these were allowed to lapse within five years, many others were sampled more or less regularly, some almost annually up to the present. Several early publications reviewing the progress of vegetation change resulted. Nothing was done towards the second aim but autecological and population dynamics studies are still being carried out, based on KVR and its records. The Bibliography contains a complete listing of research publications arising from work done on the Reserve. Much of the continuity of the earlier records is due to the efforts of Miss Constance Eardley, who while a lecturer in the Department of Botany, organised annual visits of students and staff to take records and maintain KVR. However, after 1950 the rate of sampling had begun to decline and in the mid 1960's ceased altogether for a period of several years. In the 1970's Dr Russell Sinclair reactivated the recording programme and also began a sustained effort at rabbit control. Although the Reserve was originally fenced with rabbit-proof netting, the rabbits were never eradicated and the population has fluctuated greatly with the seasons. Beginning in 1975, numbers have been kept very low by careful annual inspection and control. Since that time there has been marked seedling establishment of several tree and shrub species which showed little previous regeneration. The Reserve records now contain a history of the vegetation over 50 years without sheep grazing followed by over 30 years without significant grazing by either sheep or rabbits. Kangaroos and emus have never been excluded from the Reserve, as they can jump the fence, and their numbers vary with the seasons. The monitoring work at KVR and the curation of its records is continuing under the direction of Dr Sinclair. The Reserve is also used for post-graduate study and complements the arid-zone research interests of Environmental Biology at the Middleback Field Sation near Whyalla.; Site Description: The Reserve is located in the centre of Koonamore Station, a sheep-grazing lease 400 km north-east of Adelaide, South Australia (Lat. 32Ã\x82Âº07'S, Long. 139Ã\x82Âº20'E) in predominantly chenopod shrubland with mean annual rainfall of about 200mm. The area consists of a complex of low sand dunes alternating with sand plain and harder loam soils with travertine limestone on the intervening flats. The tree cover is a low open woodland formation. The sand dunes carry Acacia aneura (mulga), A. burkittii and Eremophila spp., the sand plain a dense stand of Casuarina pauper (blackoak, belah), and the harder loam soils a mixed community of Myoporum platycarpum (false sandalwood) and Alectryon oleifolius (bullock bush, rosewood). Understorey shrubs, which also form low chenopod shrubland communities in some areas, include Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush), A. stipitata and Maireana sedifolia (bluebush). Numerous other chenopodiaceous shrubs also occur, and grass and ephemeral herb cover varies with the seasons. Several species of Senna, Eremophila and other shrubs also occur.; Monitoring activities: Some or all of the following monitoring activities are carried out during visits to the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve: Vegetation Quadrats, Photopoints, Senna Quadrat (Cassia Corner), Myoporum platycarpum Plants, Saltbush Transects, Senna Populations, Kangaroo Transects, Rabbit Activity Monitoring and Control.; Senna Populations: Many very young Senna seedlings were identified close to the Northern boundary of the TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve, both inside and outside of the reserve in 1997. To study the effects of grazing on these seedlings outside the reserve, three populations were identified and measured to the north of the fence, and a fourth population just south of the fence, i.e. on the reserve. Different fencing treatments were applied to the plants outside the reserve fence. One was protected from sheep, the second from both sheep and rabbits, the third left unprotected. The population inside the reserve was assumed to be protected from all grazing by the reserve fence.

"[""The TGB Osborn Vegetation Reserve (or Koonamore Vegetation Reserve (KVR)) is a protected area on Koonamore Station which has been fenced off from grazing since the mid 1920's. In 1925, Professor Theodore George Bentley (TGB) Osborn and his colleagues established a vegetation reserve by fencing off 400 ha of a badly overgrazed portion of the Koonamore station to study the process of recovery of vegetation in the arid zone of South Australia after the removal of grazing pressure. The fence was established to initially keep sheep and later also rabbits from the reserve and allow vegetation regeneration.

"[""Environment          \tHastings saw the drought continue into the third year with total precipitation of only 12.92 in. compared to the average total of 21.15 in. observed over the last 48 years. The Arnold Spring gradually decreased in flow and by March was no longer providing water for the community. Showers in May extended the growing season of wildflowers and the annual grasses. Pumping from the Hastings well for domestic water increased to almost daily frequency in June.          \tWe had no wildfires. Snow fell on December 24th (3 in.) and again in early January. Finch Creek flowed in the winter, but by mid-May was dry at Martin Road. Surface water in Finch Creek dried entirely on the reserve by late June. Acorns were not plentiful, but the Acorn Woodpeckers were able to sustain normal breeding. Rooting by feral pigs was significantly reduced on most transects monitored.               Research          Museum of Vertebrate Zoology-Hastings Staff          Resident staff once again accounted for most of the research at Hastings (Table 1).          \tResearch Ecologist Dr. James Griffin continued his research studies of the ecology of California's oak woodlands. A new experimental study was designed and implemented to assess specific causes of mortality in oak seedlings. Nine hundred acorns were planted in screen pots and monitored. Dr. Griffin remains very active in statewide advisory coimittees with regard to conservation research in oak biology. Dr. Griffin was requested to consult with a variety of public and private organizations with regard to oak woodland or rare plant management.          \tAcademic Coordinator Dr. Mark Stromberg continued with preparation of manuscripts dealing with research conducted previous to assuming administrative duties at Hastings. Research regarding the roles of small mammals in the conservation biology of California oak woodlands is the subject of proposals for research support being sought from the Packard Foundation and the Carmel Ranch Company.          \tResearch Associate Dr. Janis Dickinson initiated studies of local wasp colonies and of leaf beetles on local milkweed plants. Dr. Dickinson authored 2 papers which were published this year. Dr. Dickinson presented 4 papers at various scientific meetings and co-taught a graduate seminar on social behavior on the Berkeley campus. Dr. Dickinson was an editorial reviewer for three refereed journals.          \tResearch Zoologist Dr. Walter Koenig continued several studies of social behavior in birds. Dr. Koenig completed the 18th consecutive year of detailed study of Acorn Woodpeckers in over 35 social groups on and adjacent to Hastings. Research on the effects of tannins on the digestive efficiency of Acorn Woodpeckers was published, as were results of his studies of human dispersal patterns. Dr. Koenig's studies of breeding in 363 nest boxes used by Western Bluebirds entered its 6th year. Dr. Koenig published 5 research papers, was elected as a fellow to the American Ornithologist's Union, served as Fulbright Fellow at the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, and co-authored a grant application to the Genetic Resources Conservation Program (UC-Davis) which     was approved for an ultracold freezer to store genetic resources at the Hastings Reservation. Dr. Koenig presented 8 lectures and co-taught a graduate seminar on social behavior. He was an advisor for a Master's Thesis completed this year, served on two Ph.D. committees at UC Berkeley and was an external examiner on a Ph.D. thesis at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Koenig also reviewed articles for 7 professional organizations. Various scientific papers by Hasting staff are listed in Appendix 1.          \tLong-term monitoring projects continue at Hastings. Dr. Koenig and his field assistants completed the 14th year of sampling insect populations in pan traps. Dr. Carmen sampled oaks for the 9th year in a cooperative study with Dr. Koenig of acorn production based on 250 tagged oak trees on the reservation. Dr. Griffin added the 21st year of sampling grassland productivity on Hastings. Floristic data (plant species listed by their relative abundance) were taken from plots established 20 years ago. Dr. Griffin made new maps of several plots where individual grassland plants were mapped 12 years ago. Dr. Griffin re-sampled, 40 vegetation research plots in the Chew's Ridge area which burned in the Marble Cone fire in August of 1978. Weather data were updated and correlations were compiled between the new automatic weather recording system and the older data base.          U.C. Berkeley Students          \tMost graduate students who worked at Hastings (Table 2) were once again from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ). Mark Stanback added his fifth year of field studies of the Acorn Woodpecker, focusing on behavior of the birds during the nesting period. David Ribble spent the year gathering his third year of data on movements and social behavior of the small mammals on Hastings, with emphasis on the California deer mouse. Mark Reynolds spent about half of this reporting period working to complete six years of research on social behavior and movements of the Yellow-billed Magpie: Mark Reynolds left Hastings for a position with the UC Berkeley system as manager of the Sagehen Field Station. Philip Hooge moved to Hastings to study dispersal patterns of Acorn Woodpeckers. Pat Kelly conducted field work which added his 5th year of data on the local population of wood rats, a species studied previously by Linsdale and Tevis.          \tSeveral other MVZ graduate students visited Hastings. Devin Reese surveyed the lizard populations. Maria daSilva spent several days getting acquainted with the mammalian fauna. Elizabeth Ross assisted with several research projects.          \tPam Muick (UC Forestry) continued her research on the ecology of native oak trees with Dr. Griffin. John Barthell (UC Entomology) conducted surveys for Africanized bees and documented the seasonal activity of native bees.          \tGraduate students using Hastings are listed in Table 2. Graduate students from schools other than UC Berkeley used Hastings as well (Table 2).          Other U.C. Research          \tFaculty from other California institutions spent time at Hastings (Table 1). Dr. Jeff Welker and Dr. Kevin Rice (UC Davis) made annual visits to their ongoing oak regeneration study plots. Dr. Dan Botkin visited to see the reserve and visit with the researchers. Dr. Sara Hrdy (UC Davis) visited with Dr. Walter Koenig with regard to social behavior studies. Dr. Robbie Soltz revisited bee study sites established over 10 years ago.     \tDr. Gordon Frankie, U.C. Berkeley-Entomology and his student, John Barthell, again monitored ,a series of traps for the presence of any Africanized bees.          \tRay Calloway, UC Santa Barbara, made several trips to Hastings to monitor his oak seedling, study plots. Ray is funded through the Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program. Beth Hendrickson (UC Santa Barbara), working with Dr. Griffin, studied the local turpentine weed, Trichostema lanceolatum          Research by Other Institutions          \tThe largest new research program to start at Hastings was that of Dr. Paul Ewald of Amherst College. Funded by NSF for 2 years, Dr. Ewald arrived June 15 to spend the, summer gathering data on territorial behavior of resident hummingbirds. Dr. Ewald and his assistants set up several patches of electronically controlled robotic flowers with artificial nectar. Observations and behavior data were entered directly into portable computers.          \tDr. Tom Nash, Arizona State University, was successful in seeking NSF support to re-establish his research program on the lichen, Ramalina in the spring of 1990. Dr. Ron Mumme (Memphis State University) visited Hastings as part of his continuing collaboration with Dr. Koenig on Acorn Woodpeckers. Dr. Tim Pritchard visited as a part of a tour of biological field stations. Dr. Tim Plumb and Dr. Larry Riggs were here to follow up on continuing oak tree studies and collaborate with Dr. Griffin. Dr. Joe Marshall (USFWS- National Museum) was here to study winter bird flocks. Dr. Stan Faeth (Arizona State University) established some monitoring stations for insects which affect oak growth. Dr. Dave Gubernick (Univ. Wisconsin-Madison) videotaped California deer mice in their subterranean dens with Dave Ribble. Dr. Don Kramer (McGill) visited with Dr. Koenig to observe Acorn Woodpeckers. Bennie Hannah, a student at Cal Poly, made several trips to monitor other oak regeneration plots.               Education          \tClass use at Hastings is summarized in Table 3. Four classes with a total of 57 students used Hastings for natural history studies. Class use of Hastings remains limited by the lack of a group facility.          \tHastings continues to offer an important educational experience for undergraduates who wish to work with advanced researchers in field biology. Dr. Koenig and his students Mark Stanback and Phil Hooge, worked with 9 field assistants this year (Table 4). Dave Ribble trained 6 field assistants to track the movements of deermice in undisturbed microhabitats of Hastings woodlands. Dr. Jim Griffin was assisted in his studies of the vegetation of the Santa Lucia mountains by a student from Stanford. The wide variety of field assistant involvement at Hastings is summarized in Table 4.          \tIn a program which is scheduled to continue through next year, Dr. Paul Ewald directed a group of 5 field assistants in his study of the territorial behavior of hummingbirds. Each of his assistants is preparing independent research papers in addition to collecting data for the larger research project directed by Dr. Ewald.""]",['Mark R.

"['Study History: Project 320-H received funding in 5 consecutive fiscal years beginning in FY 94 and concluding in FY 98 to investigate the role of zooplankton in processes influencing the survival of juvenile pink salmon and herring; FY 99 was designated a close-out year. Project H was a core component of the larger Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program. Zooplankton serves as food for many fish, bird and marine mammal stocks. SEA investigated its role as forage for juvenile fishes including pink salmon and herring, and also as alternative prey for predators that also consume juvenile pink salmon and herring in seasonally varying complex food webs. Previous annual reports of project 320-H appear in the integrated SEA report series for FY 94, FY 95, FY 96 and FY 97. This final report includes work completed in FY 98.\n\nThe data for this project was pulled from the UAF School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences public data portal at the following URL: http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/dm/ims-data-archive/DataBase/ZOOPLANKTON/PWS-SEA/.

"[""This survey is part of the Biological Survey of SA programme run by the Biological Survey & Monitoring group in DEH. Survey areas defined in a DEH spatial layer managed by DEH Environmental Information Group. The survey sampled, described and mapped the vegetation and recorded the associated fauna from as many as possible of South Australia's offshore islands. All offshore islands from Nuyts Reef in the west to Penguin Island in the South East of South Australia were visited between 1971 and 1982. Several groups of islands are not covered including the islands in Pelican Lagoon on Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island itself and the islands in the Coorong Lagoon. Torrens and Garden Islands, the mangroves and saltmarsh covered islands north of Port Adelaide and Entrance Island in Franklin Harbour are excluded, as they are better treated as part of the mangrove complex along the St Vincent Gulf and Spencer Gulf coasts. The Offshore Islands Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.

"[""The Tothill Ranges, is a low range (up to 650m above SL) running 15km south-north, north-east of Marrabel. It contains the largest area of remnant vegetation in the Northern & Yorke NRM Board region that is outside the DEH reserve system. Part of the Northern Mount Lofty Ranges, both the size and position of this remnant sitting in 'a sea' of cleared land ensures the conservation of this area is paramount in the protection of biodiversity of this region. The Tothill Ranges sit on the eastern edge of the Northern Agricultural area, the western edge of the Murray Darling Basin near Hopkins Creek Conservation Park and is less than 80 km south east of the Southern Flinders. It has been listed as both the largest remnant and key area in managing salinity in the Upper River Light Catchment (Upper Light River Salinity Management Plan 2003). The Nature Conservation Society South Australia will be conducting flora and fauna surveys, using standard Biological Survey of SA methodology over 10 days (Sep-Oct 2008), at 16 sites in privately owned land being managed for conservation.

"['The 1971+ Tropical Rainforest Plot Network Rainforest Tree Demographic Data contains stem measurement data from 20 permanent  0.5 ha (100 m x 50 m) rainforest plots in Northern Queensland, Australia. The CSIRO permanent rainforest plots are located within 60 km of the north Queensland coast between Mackay (21.5ÂºS, 149ÂºE) and the Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (12.5ÂºS, 143ÂºE). The plots have a rainfall range of 1200 to 3500 mm, represent eleven vegetation types, six parent materials, and range from 15 m to 1200 m above sea level. Except for minor disturbances associated with selective logging on two plots, the plots were established in old growth forest and all plots have thereafter been protected. Plots were regularly censused and at each census the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all stems â\x89¥10 cm DBH is recorded.  Due to the wide geographical range of the plots, no species dominate, although the families Lauraceae, Rutaceae and Myrtaceae contribute a large number of species. The data collected from these 20 plots provides an insight into the floristical composition, structure and long term forest dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests and allows direct comparisons to be made with long-term monitoring plots at a global scale.

"[""The project is to undertake surveys of fauna and flora in remnant vegetation on private land in the Southern Flinders Ranges, southern Yorke Peninsula, and other priority areas in the Northern and Yorke NRM Region. The aim of the project is to support landscape conservation and restoration of native fauna and flora habitat in the Northern & Yorke region. To achieve this we need a better understanding of the species and habitat areas present on private land. We will then use this information to support and directly involve land owners/managers in active management of the natural biodiversity on their properties. The project is based around groups of interested landholders in signifcant biodiversity areas of the region. Participation of adjoining landholders will be encouraged, to achieve a landscape approach to habitat restoration and management. The project will improve regional knowledge of native fauna and flora and contribute new data to the BDBSA database. It will also develop the skills of DENR staff, NRM staff and land owners/managers in plant and animal identification, safe and ethical animal trapping practises and animal handling techniques. Project started in 2010 and is ongoing.

"[""The project is to undertake surveys of fauna and flora in remnant vegetation on private land in the Southern Flinders Ranges, southern Yorke Peninsula, and other priority areas in the Northern and Yorke NRM Region. The aim of the project is to support landscape conservation and restoration of native fauna and flora habitat in the Northern & Yorke region. To achieve this we need a better understanding of the species and habitat areas present on private land. We will then use this information to support and directly involve land owners/managers in active management of the natural biodiversity on their properties. The project is based around groups of interested landholders in signifcant biodiversity areas of the region. Participation of adjoining landholders will be encouraged, to achieve a landscape approach to habitat restoration and management. The project will improve regional knowledge of native fauna and flora and contribute new data to the BDBSA database. It will also develop the skills of DENR staff, NRM staff and land owners/managers in plant and animal identification, safe and ethical animal trapping practises and animal handling techniques. Project started in 2010 and is ongoing. The BIODIVERSITY ON PRIVATE LAND, NORTHERN & YORKE Survey is part of the Biological Survey of South Australia Program which is a series of systematic surveys conducted across the state between 1971 and the present with the broad aim of providing a baseline inventory of South Australia's flora and fauna biodiversity.

All offshore islands from Nuyts Reef in the west to Penguin Island in the South East of South Australia were visited between 1971 and 1982. Several groups of islands are not covered including the islands in Pelican Lagoon on Kangaroo Island, Kangaroo Island itself and the islands in the Coorong Lagoon. Torrens and Garden Islands, the mangroves and saltmarsh covered islands north of Port Adelaide and Entrance Island in Franklin Harbour are excluded, as they are better treated as part of the mangrove complex along the St Vincent Gulf and Spencer Gulf coasts.

"[""The SWATT is an initiative developed collaboratively by TERN's Australian Transect Network and the Department of Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia (DPaW). The SWATT is one of four national ecological transects or plot networks that traverse key Australian terrestrial ecosystems. The principal purpose of the transects is to measure selected biodiversity attributes along with biophysical processes, that will inform key ecosystem science questions and assist with the development and validation of ecosystem models. Transects will enable benchmarking and subsequent monitoring of trends in ecological condition in response to continental scale biophysical processes such as climate change. The SWATT is located in the south west of Western Australian extending for over 1,200km from Walpole on the south coast to just beyond the former pastoral lease of Lorna Glen and into the Little Sandy Desert.  The SWATT incorporates the internationally recognised biodiversity hotspot that is the Southwest Botanical Province (Myers et al. 2000, Hopper P &amp; Gioia 2004), a national biodiversity hotspot (Central and Eastern Avon Wheatbelt) and the evolutionary significant species rich Southwest Interzone (Hopper 1979, Gibson et al. 2010) which includes the globally significant Great Western Woodlands (GWW) (Watson et al. 2009).

"['The Tropical Rainforest Plot Network Rainforest Understorey Floristic Data contains understorey floristic data from all 20 of its 0.5 ha (100 m x 50 m) permanent rainforest plots in Northern Queensland, Australia. Data was collected for all plots at the time of establishment before 1981 and data was again collected for half of the plots post-2000.    The CSIRO permanent rainforest plots are located within 60 km of the north Queensland coast between Mackay (21.5ÂºS, 149ÂºE) and the Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula (12.5ÂºS, 143ÂºE). The plots have a rainfall range of 1200 to 3500 mm, represent eleven vegetation types, six parent materials, and range from 15 m to 1200 m above sea level. Except for minor disturbances associated with selective logging on two plots, the plots were established in old growth forest and all plots have thereafter been protected.  In conjunction with the Tree Demographic Data packages which have been collected by the Tropical Rainforest Plot Network, the data collected from these 20 plots provides an insight into the floristical composition, structure and long term forest dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests and allows direct comparisons to be made with long-term monitoring plots at a global scale.

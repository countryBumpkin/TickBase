"[""This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's testing of blood samples from individual small mammals for seroposivity to hantaviruses. Small mammal blood samples were tested for hantaviruses from 2014-2019. Beginning in 2020 rodent pathogen testing focuses on tick-borne diseases. The blood samples are collected as part of the mark-recapture, box trapping effort for small mammals (i.e., rodents (Rodentia) < 600 grams), with the field capture results available separately via the Small mammal box trapping data product (NEON.DP1.10072). Small mammals are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians. Blood samples are collected from individuals of target species of rodents, including all species in the families Cricetidae, Muridae, and Dipodidae, if an individual weighs more than 10 grams and is in good physical condition. In a typical year, only a subset of blood samples collected will be tested, up to approximately 140 samples per NEON site, with the remaining samples archived. The sample identifiers for the blood samples allow users to link the pathogen test results provided in this data product to the field collection information, including taxonomic identification of the capture, to the Small mammal box trapping data product (NEON.DP1.10072).

"['Net surface-atmosphere exchange, or “flux” quantifies how much heat, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are transferred between an ecosystem and the atmosphere. Fluxes are useful in a variety scientific applications, including to study ecosystem processes, to interpret and calibrate satellite observations of the earth system, and to constrain ecosystem and earth system models. One of the most direct approaches to observe the net surface-atmosphere exchange is the in-situ [eddy-covariance method](https://youtu.be/CR4Anc8Mkas). Calculation of the net surface-atmosphere exchange involves the estimation of at least two major terms (assuming horizontally homogenous surface conditions): the turbulent flux and the storage flux. In addition, stable isotope measurements of CO2 and H2O within and above the ecosystem canopy can support the subsequent partitioning of the net surface-atmosphere exchange into ecosystem constituent fluxes. For example, partitioning CO2 into photosynthesis and respiration, or evaporation and transpiration in the case of H2O.\n\nFor data product and algorithm details please see [NEON.DOC.004571](http://data.neonscience.org/documents); in short: this data product bundle contains derived eddy-covariance data products and associated metadata in HDF5 format.

He also recommends a policy to adopt mobile phones for use as both the technology solution and access devices solution, and adds that renewable energy solutions, particularly solar energy, must be advanced to ensure availability of electricity for all residents, a necessity for education and skill development.']","['Sebusang, S.']",['10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],[''],['Cloud-Based Solutions for Education and Skill Development – Botswana']
"['Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can enhance understanding of global biodiversity by making it possible to study taxonomic groups that are difficult to sample. However, experimental choices made when generating eDNA data can impact biodiversity surveys and must be carefully considered during study design. Here, we explored the impact of DNA extraction protocol and metabarcode choice on recovery of meiofauna DNA from sand. We extracted DNA from untreated sand and from sand treated with either Ludox or MgCl 2 and amplified DNA using the 18S and CO1 metabarcodes. We found differences in species composition and richness both between metabarcodes and among sampling strategies, confirming the sensitivity of the experiments to both parameters. Combining data from multiple barcodes and from multiple extraction protocols increased recovered meiofaunal taxonomic diversity. Future metabarcoding studies and meta-analyses should consider the effects of sampling protocols on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the need to continue to improve existing reference databases of morphological and molecular characterization of meiofauna, in particular of the tropics, which are poorly represented in existing databases.']","['Castro, Lyda R., [Meyer, Rachel S.], [Shapiro, Beth], [Shirazi, Sabrina], [Cutler, Samuel], [Lagos, Ana M.], [Quiroga, Sigmer Y.]']",['10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],[''],['Metabarcoding meiofauna biodiversity assessment in four beaches of Northern Colombia: effects of sampling protocols and primer choice']
"['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great attentions over the past few decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Crystallization is sought in many application fields since it allows enhancing or even promoting properties of catalysis, energy storage and photoelectric properties. However, the crystallization process of nanostructured COFs remains to be challenging. Synthetic approaches to establish nucleation and elongation growth of COFs for controlling crystallization have drawn substantial amount of attentions. Nanostructured COFs have exhibited significant advantages when applied in (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices as well. In this review, recent progress in precisely design strategy of fabricating various nanostructured COFs and their applications as (electro)photocatalyzer and energy storage devices are summarized. After a brief introduction of the design principles, composition and interior architecture, the morphology of nanostructured COFs including porous and mesoporous stacked-layer structure, nanosheet structure, nanorod structure, ordered stripe arrays and various nanocomposites are thoroughly described. Reactions dedicated to crystallization process for two-dimensional (2D) COFs are discussed further. Then, the applications of nanostructured COFs as (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges for the synthetic technology of nanostructured COFs materials are particularly discussed. Personal insights into the challenges and opportunities on pursuing topologies as hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk–shell structures were raised to broaden the applications.']","['Chen, Haoyun, [Yuan, Xingzhong], [Wang, Hou], [Yu, Hanbo], [Jiang, Longbo]']",['10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],[''],['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks with elevated crystallization for (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices']
"['According to modern classification, tick-borne flaviviruses have been divided into a mammalian tick-borne virus group and a seabird tick-borne virus group (STBVG). The STBVG includes the Tyuleniy virus, Meaban virus, Saumarez Reef virus, and the recently discovered Kama virus (KAMV). The latter was isolated from Ixodes lividus , an obligate parasitic tick of the sand martin ( Riparia riparia ), in 1989 in the central part of the Russian Plain. In 2014, based on molecular genetic analysis, it was shown that KAMV is a new virus belonging to STBVG, genus Flavivirus , fam. Flaviviridae . Very little is known about the Kama virus concerning its range, vectors, and reservoir hosts. GenBank contains a single sequence of the complete genome of this virus. In the present study, the complete genome sequences of two strains, isolated in 1983 in the Omsk region (Western Siberia) from gamasid mites in the nests of rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ), have been determined. Phylogenetic analyses of their genomes showed a close relationship both with each other (approx. 98.9% nucleotide identity) and with KAMV isolated in European Russia (approx. 98.4% nucleotide identity). The ecological features of KAMV that are due to the species of the vector (gamasid mites) and its hosts (colonial birds of the mainland of Eurasia) indicate that KAMV is an atypical representative STBVG.']","['Kovalev, S.

Our analysis is based on administrative county-level data on vaccination purchases linked to indicators of media coverage of the meningococcal disease and to administrative records of disease incidence.

"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 117:32493, 2020a), where we reported that BCP/BCPO (beta-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide) in fresh horse manure is sufficient to drive manure rolling behavior (HMR) in giant panda and attenuate the cold sensitivity of mice by directly targeting and inhibiting transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an archetypical cold-activated ion channel of mammals. The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']
"['Probability of informed trading (PIN) models characterize trading with certain types of information through a tree structure. Different tree structures with different numbers of groups for market participants have been proposed, with no clear, consistent tree used in the literature. One of the main causes of this inconsistency is that these trees are artificially proposed through a bottom-up approach rather than implied by actual market data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that infers a tree structure directly from empirical data. More precisely, we use hierarchical clustering to construct a tree for each individual firm and then infer an aggregate tree through a voting mechanism. We test this method on US data from January 2002 for 7608 companies, which results in a tree with two layers and four groups. The characteristics of the resulting aggregate tree are between those of several proposed tree structures in the literature, demonstrating that these proposed trees all reflect only part of the market, and one should consider the proposed empirically driven method when seeking a tree representing the whole market.']","['Lin, Emily, [Kao, Chu-Lan Michael], [Adityarini, Natasha Sonia]']",['10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],[''],['Data-driven tree structure for PIN models']
"['The aim of this study was to explore the associations between temperamental reactivity and regulation and the emergence of anxiety traits in a longitudinal sample of infants enriched for later ASD. Parents of 143 infants who were at high- and low-risk for ASD rated their child’s temperament traits when they were 9, 15 and 24\xa0months old; they rated anxiety and ASD traits when they were 36\xa0months old. The findings suggest that behavioural inhibition may be an early predictor of later anxiety in children with and without ASD and that lower levels of effortful control in children who later develop ASD may contribute to the higher expression of anxiety within this population.']","['Ersoy, Mutluhan, [Charman, Tony], [Pasco, Greg], [Carr, Ewan], [Johnson, Mark H.], [Jones, Emily J.

"['Mating with the wrong species is surprisingly common in nature. Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

"['Free-ranging giant pandas ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) in China recently were reported to rub and roll in horse manure, a behavior that was observed frequently at low ambient temperatures.

Mice\xa0and rats treated with BCP/BCPO exhibited enhanced cold tolerance in behavioral assays, and BCP/BCPO inhibited cold-activated ion channels of mammals expressed in human kidney cells; these laboratory results were cited in support of the contention that giant pandas tolerate low ambient temperatures by applying horse manure to their integument. The demonstrated biocidal activities of BCP and BCPO against insects and ticks, and the reported elicitation of anointing in giant pandas with materials other than horse manure, including substances or constituents thereof known to act as arthropod biocides, are consistent with an anti-consumer function of anointing by giant pandas.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions.

Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Purpose Women’s worry about developing breast cancer may influence their decision to use preventive therapy. However, the direction of this relationship has been questioned. We prospectively investigated the relationship between breast cancer worry and uptake of preventive therapy. The socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with high breast cancer worry were also investigated. Methods Women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited from clinics across England ( n \u2009=\u2009408). Participants completed a survey on their breast cancer worry, socio-demographic and clinical factors. Uptake of tamoxifen was recorded at 3\xa0months ( n \u2009=\u2009258 women, 63.2%). Both primary and sensitivity analyses were conducted using different classifications of low, medium and high worry. Results 39.5% of respondents reported medium breast cancer worry at baseline and 21.2% reported high worry. Ethnic minority women were more likely to report high worry than white women (OR\u2009=\u20093.02, 95%CI 1.02, 8.91, p \u2009=\u20090.046). Women educated below degree level were more likely to report high worry than those with higher education (OR\u2009=\u20092.29, 95%CI 1.28, 4.09, p \u2009=\u20090.005). No statistically significant association was observed between worry and uptake.

"['Aims CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes. It is currently unclear whether daily glucose variability contributes to CVD. Therefore, we investigated whether glucose variability is associated with arterial measures that are considered important in CVD pathogenesis. Methods We included participants of The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort, who underwent at least 48\xa0h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ( n \u2009=\u2009853; age: 59.9\u2009±\u20098.6\xa0years; 49% women, 23% type 2 diabetes). We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

This survey was created to illuminate which and how qMRI techniques are currently applied across Europe. Methods In total, 4753 neuroradiologists from 27 countries received an online questionnaire. Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85). QIBA and EIBALL were not well known (12.5%, n = 34, and 11.0%, n = 30). Conclusions The clinical implementation of qMRI methods is highly variable. Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']
"['Experimental closure of the surface energy balance during convective periods is a long-standing problem. With experimental data from the Idealized horizontal Planar Array experiment for Quantifying Surface heterogeneity, the terms of the temperature-tendency equation are computed, with an emphasis on the total derivative. The experiment occurred at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test facility at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground during the summer of 2019. The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ).

A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings.

The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001).

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"

"['The large integration of variable energy resources is expected to shift a large part of the energy exchanges closer to real-time, where more accurate forecasts are available. In this context, the short-term electricity markets and in particular the intraday market are considered a suitable trading floor for these exchanges to occur. A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']

CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution into constituent cell types. CIM-seq estimates parameters such as number of cells and cell types in each multiplet directly from sequencing data, making it compatible with high-throughput droplet-based methods. When applied to gut epithelium or whole dissociated lung and spleen, CIM-seq correctly identifies known interactions, including those between different cell lineages and immune cells. In the colon, CIM-seq identifies a previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1 , which is directly adjacent to colonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that CIM-seq is broadly applicable to unsupervised profiling of cell-type interactions in different tissue types.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum . This study provides crucial information for ungulate management as a tool to mitigate zoonotic disease risk and argues for adapting management approaches to the local ungulate species composition and the pathogen(s) of concern.

Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks play a vital role as vectors in the transmission of Anaplasma pathogens. However, the Anaplasma species carried by H. longicornis in China are yet to be characterized. In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools. All tick sample pools were examined for the presence of Anaplasma species via nested PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA, major surface protein 4 ( msp4 ), or citric acid synthase ( gltA ) genes, which were sequenced to determine the molecular and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolates. The overall Anaplasma spp-positive rate of H. longicornis was determined to be 26.68% (99/371). The percentage prevalence of A. phagocytophilum -like1, A. bovis , A. ovis , A. marginale , and A. capra were 1.08% (4/371), 13.21% (49/371), 13.21% (49/371), 1.35% (5/371), and 10.24% (38/371), respectively, and the co-infection rate of two or more types of Anaplasma was 6.47% (24/371). Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of A. phagocytophilum into an A. phagocytophilum -like1 ( Anaplasma sp. Japan) group. Anaplasma bovis sequences obtained in this study were 99.8–100% identical to those of an earlier strain isolated from a Chinese tick (GenBank accession no. KP314251). Anaplasma ovis sequences showed 99.3–99.6% identity to an A. ovis human strain identified from a Cypriot patient (GenBank accession no. FJ460443). Only one msp4 sequence of A. marginale was detected and was grouped with those of other A. marginale isolates, and these A. capra isolates obtained in this present study may be zoonotic. The detection and characterization of four Anaplasma species in H. longicornis in this study have added to the current knowledge of the parasite and provided data on multiple Anaplasma species with veterinary and medical significance from four provinces of China.']","['Yan, Yaqun, [Wang, Kunlun], [Cui, Yanyan], [Zhou, Yongchun], [Zhao, Shanshan], [Zhang, Yajun], [Jian, Fuchun], [Wang, Rongjun], [Zhang, Longxian], [Ning, Changshen]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],[''],['Molecular detection and phylogenetic analyses of Anaplasma spp. in Haemaphysalis longicornis from goats in four provinces of China']
"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks. We believe that this approach will aid in large-scale pathogen screening of arthropods to be used in vector-borne disease control programs.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease.

Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases.

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world. Conclusions Despite holding much significance to the animal sector, comprehensive disease mapping has yet not been undertaken in several parts of India. The present study provides a blue print of disease mapping, epidemiological correlations and genomic diversity of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata circulating in the region.']","['Kaur, Rabjot, [Yadav, Anish], [Rafiqi, Shafiya I.], [Godara, Rajesh], [Sudan, Vikrant], [Chakraborty, D.], [Katoch, Rajesh]']",['10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],[''],"['Epidemiology, haematology and molecular characterization of haemoprotozoon and rickettsial organisms causing infections in cattle of Jammu region, North India']"

"['Introduction Anaplasma sp. is an obligatory intracellular Gram-negative tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are the drugs of choice for treating domestic animals with acute anaplasmosis. Lack of documented information about oxytetracycline resistance in Anaplasma species in the world was the scope of this study to screen by PCR for the detection of the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in Anaplasma species from infected cattle and sheep in the Northwest and Southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods Total of 100 cattle and sheep blood samples collected from 2 provinces in the Northwest and 1 province in the Southwest of Iran were tested microscopically by the Giemsa staining examination and confirmed by PCR. Then the presence of two different oxytetracycline-resistance genes ( otrA, and otrB ) was detected by PCR in positive samples. Results The results showed that 60% of Anaplasma -infected samples were identified to have an otrA -resistance gene, and 26.67% had an otrB -resistance gene. The coexistence of two oxytetracycline-resistance determinants was encountered in 13.33% of the isolates. The significant difference in the frequency of otr genes was found among three Anaplasma species ( A. marginale , A. centrale and A. ovis ), and among three studied regions in Iran ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The identified sequences were submitted to the GenBank and deposited under accession numbers MN880729 and MN895439 for otrB and otrA genes.

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']
"['Ticks will diminish productivity among farm animals and transmit zoonotic diseases. We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%). Among all ticks, 32 (11%) were positive for Rickettsia spp. and 15 (5.2%) of these were identified as R. africae comprising at least two genetic clades, occurring in A. variegatum (n\u2009=\u200910) and A. cohaerens (n\u2009=\u20095).

The authors suspect that because the zoo differs in its sanitary and veterinary conditions from those found in nature, the results obtained here may differ markedly from those existing in the natural environment. Although we cannot be certain at this stage that the mites did not carry other pathogens in addition to those that were detectable by the primers that were used, the erythematous reaction to bite marks likely reflects a response to secretions of the mites rather than to transmitted pathogens.']","['Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta, [Gwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],[''],"['Do ectoparasites of the slow loris Nycticebus pygmaeus, pose a danger to humans?']"
"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis.

"['Background Various tick-borne infections like borreliosis and rickettsiosis pose a health risk to humans in many parts of the world. We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. Methods Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. Results Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. Conclusions Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti- Borrelia -antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years. Rickettsiosis is of limited concern in Denmark.

The aim of this study is to screen the important tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) carried by hard ticks in Inner Mongolia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and to estimate the risk of human infection imposed by tick bites. Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level. Individual tick DNA samples were detected by genus--specific or group-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these TBPs and combined with DNA sequencing assay to confirm the results of mNGS. Results R. raoultii (45.32%, 92/203), Candidatus R. tarasevichiae (5.42%, 11/203), Anaplasma sp.

"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals. Conclusions Most of the studied pathogenic agents are present in the prospected area, indicating a possible risk for both human and animal health.

"['Background Canine babesiosis and anaplasmosis, caused by Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , respectively, are significant tick-borne diseases in Baltic countries. Both diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of clinicopathological findings, by direct pathogen detection in blood smears or by indirect pathogen detection; however, because of high selectivity and specificity, molecular methods may be advantageous. The goal of this study was to develop a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase, (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and serum protein profiles in dogs affected with naturally acquired ehrlichiosis. Methods The animal materials had been consisted of ten dogs naturally infected with Ehrlichia canis , and ten controls negative for Ehrlichia canis . TAC, MDA, NO, SOD, GSH-Px, ADA activity and TP, ALB, GLOB levels were measured in sera of the animals. The serum protein concentrations were measured by autoanalyzer. The electrophoretic profiles of serum total protein were determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native-PAGE). Results In dogs with ehrlichiosis, decreased TAC ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GSH-Px ( P \u2009>\u20090.05) levels were determined. However, NO ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), SOD ( P \u2009<\u20090.05), ADA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), MDA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), TP ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GLO ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) levels were found as increased in the Ehrlichia positive dogs.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites and transmit various types of protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases in a wild as well as domestic animals and humans globally. Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

"['The aim of this study is to make aware every one of the deadliest diseases named severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). It has become the worldwide pandemic in recent few years. It is a kind of haemorrhagic fever, caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus of family Bunyaviridae. This syndrome is also a tick-borne zoonosis that means the virus transmitted from tick bite (having virus) into human body, i.e. infection spread from animals to humans and also transmitted from human to human. Epidemiological data of SFTS was collected to know the nature/symptoms of SFTSV. First case of this disease has been reported in China, followed by Japan, South korea, Taiwan, USA and many other countries. Vertebrates are the host of this disease and tick functions as a vector, where the virus can undergo brisk changes using gene mutation, homologous recombination and reassortments. The major symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Sometimes in very severe cases, full body organ failure may also take place and average death rate in humans is nearly 10\u2009%. Old aged peoples are more prone to SFTSV infection. Apart from the fact of increasing SFTSV related health problems to humans, the pathogenesis of SFTS virus in human is not entirely understood and no treatment to this virus is still available. The simplest way to protect our self from this infection is to refrain from tick bite. Therefore, this disease has evolved to produce serious health issues to humans in various countries of world including china.

"['Background Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a serious threat to humans, wildlife and livestock, and cause severe economic losses in many tropical drylands. The effective control of TBDs has been constrained by limited understanding of what determines tick loads in animals. We tested interactive effects of several biological factors (sex, age and body condition), one environmental factor (rainfall) and one human factor (management type) on tick loads in animals. Methods We collected ticks on animals at four sampling sites in the semi-arid savanna area of Laikipia County, Kenya, of which two are commercial ranches and the other two are open pastoral grazing areas. From 2017 to 2019, we collected a total of 2038 ticks from 619 domestic animals from various cattle and camel herds and from 79 tranquilised wild animals. Results Generally, wild herbivores (zebras, rhinos and elephants) had higher tick loads than domestic animals. As 83% of the tick samples were taken from Boran cattle, we analysed tick load in these cattle in more detail. Boran cattle had high tick loads in the wet season, especially those animals in poor condition. No differences were found between female and male cattle, regardless of season. The calves had high tick loads during both the wet and dry seasons, whereas the sub-adult and adult cattle had less ticks during the dry season. Cattle on the intensively managed ranches had lower tick load than those in the transhumant management system. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of establishing effective control of ticks on domestic animals in transhumant management systems as tick loads were high on these animals in both the wet and dry season.

Adult and larval tick DNA were amplified by PCR and later sequenced to identify mutations, if any, in the domain II S4-5 linker and domain III S6 regions in para voltage-gated sodium channel gene, at loci that were previously documented to be associated with deltamethrin resistance. Allele-specific PCR was performed for the amplification of target gene locus (C190A and T2134C) to genotype 1000 larvae each, at these loci. Genotype frequency was statistically analysed by Chi-square test. Results Bioassay using LPT revealed that LC 50 and LC 95 values of all the R. (B.) microplus isolates in this study were more than double the reported values of reference susceptible strain. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons of domain II S4-5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene revealed C190A mutation, A271G mutation as well as A–G mutation at 217th position. AS-PCR done to genotype C190A mutations revealed a frequency of 6%, 15% and 64%, respectively for homozygous-susceptible (SS), heterozygous (RS) and homozygous-resistant (RR) genotypes. In domain III S6 region of the gene, C2121T and A2102T mutations were observed. AS-PCR to genotype the previously reported T2134C mutation revealed 100% SS genotype in R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala. Conclusions Genotyping of R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala for target site mutations reportedly associated with deltamethrin resistance revealed a significantly high frequency of resistant genotypes at II S4–5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene. This study forms the first report of such mutations in Kerala, south India and demands serious attention in the light of increased prevalence of tick-borne haemoparasitic infection.']","['Amrutha, Anand, [Bindu, Lakshmanan], [Siju, J.], [Aravindakshan, T.

A standard indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used to determine antibodies to Babesia bigemina , Babesia bovis , and Ehrlichia ruminantium and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for antibodies to Anaplasma marginale detection. The highest tick loads were observed on cattle during the hot-wet and post-rainy seasons and lowest during the cool-dry season. The E. ruminantium prevalence in Elundini was 16% and 14% in post-rainy and hot-dry seasons respectively and 15% at Senqu during the post-rainy season.

"['Objectives Although there are promising studies on cancer treatment, it is still a frightening disease. For effective treatment, an integrative and positive perspective is required. Using the power of metaphors to facilitate understanding of complex and intangible ideas, this study aims to define cancer from the perspective of Turkish nursing students. Sample and Setting This study was conducted with 166 nursing students at a nursing faculty in Turkey. It was a mixed method study using qualitative and quantitative methods. Methods and Variables To capture the picture in a human mind of the complexity of feelings for cancer, writing a description and elicitation interviews were employed. Moreover, to reach ontological and epistemological level thoughts in the deepest layers of elicited metaphors, the data were analyzed in an analytical framework. Results The study provides a conceptualization of ""Cancer."" The students produced 92 valid metaphors. The most commonly used metaphors were found to be ‘death\', ‘war\', ‘a virus\', ‘a malady\' and ‘a spider\'. It was found that the metaphors produced by the students on the concept of cancer generally used negative themes. Implications for Nursing This study provides a framework for understanding all aspects of the concept of cancer on the metaphor axis. It is believed that the results will provide an holistic approach toward the concept of cancer, especially in nursing education, and will increase awareness of this concept.']","['Usta Yeşilbalkan, Öznur, [Kankaya, Hülya], [Karaman, Emine], [Çinar, Derya]']",['10.1007/s10943-021-01275-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01275-w'],[''],['Eliciting the Concept of Cancer in Nursing Students in Turkey: an Exploratory Metaphor Analysis']
"['Formative assessment practices for secondary mathematics have been advocated as valuable for students, but difficult for teachers to learn. There have been calls in the literature to increase the emphasis on formative assessment in mathematics teacher preparation courses. This study explored the use of peer-assessment strategies for helping pre-service secondary mathematics teachers (PSTs) cultivate formative assessment principles and practices for assessing school students. Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of: sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments. We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in Practice to characterize the PSTs’ perceptions of their experience of formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students, in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on average less confidence in assessing school student task responses themselves than in assessing peer work.

"['Abstract The extent to which host group size affects the hosts’ exposure to parasites and pathogens has been explored by behavioral ecologists for almost 50\xa0years, and we know that host and parasite taxa, mobility of host and parasite, and the extent of spatial structure within groups all affect the group-size relationship. Here we examine how the prevalence of an arthropod-borne viral pathogen changes with host group size in a host-parasite system recently invaded by an introduced species that also serves as a host for the virus. Infection by the alphavirus, Buggy Creek virus (BCRV), in swallow bugs ( Cimex vicarius ) increased with colony size of the cliff swallow ( Petrochelidon pyrrhonota ; the bugs’ principal host) in the absence of invasive house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) but decreased with swallow colony size in the presence of sparrows. The sparrow-adapted lineage A of BCRV declined to near extinction in the largest cliff swallow colonies, regardless of sparrow presence. The results may reflect BCRV’s divergence into a lineage (B) that amplifies mostly in bugs and thus is transmitted more effectively in large cliff swallow colonies that maintain high numbers of the blood-feeding bugs, whereas the other lineage (A) is adapted to house sparrows and does not require large numbers of bugs and cliff swallows for effective transmission and persistence. The results show that an alternative host can modify the group-size consequences for the original host and illustrate another complexity in analyzing the costs and benefits of coloniality whenever invasive species are present. Significance statement Predicting the spread of viral pathogens can be important in assessing threats to wildlife or humans, and the size of a host’s social group is regarded as a potentially important determinant of pathogen exposure. Invasive species can sometimes profoundly alter disease dynamics when they enter a host-parasite system and serve as alternative hosts, thereby either increasing or decreasing the original host’s exposure to pathogens. For an arthropod-borne virus that is vectored by a blood-feeding bug that parasitizes a colonially breeding bird, we found that virus infection in bugs increased with host (bird) group size when an invasive bird species was absent but decreased with host group size when the invasive was present. The study indicates that the presence of alternative hosts is another variable to consider in trying to predict how pathogen exposure is affected by host group size.']","['Moore, Amy T., [O’Brien, Valerie A.], [Brown, Charles R.]']",['10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],[''],['Group-size effects on virus prevalence depend on the presence of an invasive species']
"['Orexin (hypocretin), is a neuropeptide produced by a subset of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. From the lateral hypothalamus, the orexin-containing neurons project their fibres extensively to other brain structures, and the spinal cord constituting the central orexinergic system. Generally, the term ‘’orexinergic system’’ usually refers to the orexin peptides and their receptors, as well as to the orexin neurons and their projections to different parts of the central nervous system. The extensive networks of orexin axonal fibres and their terminals allow these neuropeptidergic neurons to exert great influence on their target regions. The hypothalamic neurons containing the orexin neuropeptides have been implicated in diverse functions, especially related to the control of a variety of homeostatic functions including feeding behaviour, arousal, wakefulness stability and energy expenditure. The broad range of functions regulated by the orexinergic system has led to its description as ‘’physiological integrator’’. In the last two decades, the orexinergic system has been a topic of great interest to the scientific community with many reports in the public domain. From the documentations, variations exist in the neuroanatomical profile of the orexinergic neuron soma, fibres and their receptors from animal to animal. Hence, this review highlights the distinct variabilities in the morphophysiological aspects of the orexinergic system in the vertebrate animals, mammals and non-mammals, its presence in other brain-related structures, including its involvement in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. The presence of the neuropeptide in the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral tissues, as well as its alteration in different animal models and conditions are also reviewed.']","['Azeez, Idris A., [Igado, Olumayowa O.], [Olopade, James O.]']",['10.1007/s11011-021-00761-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11011-021-00761-0'],[''],['An overview of the orexinergic system in different animal species']

The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

Blood was collected from wild northern cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) in College Station, Texas, and screened for the presence of Haemoproteus spp. parasites using microscopic and molecular methods. Experimental groups of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were offered Haemoproteus -positive cardinal blood through an artificial feeding apparatus, while control groups received Haemoproteus -negative cardinal blood or domestic canary ( Serinus canaria domestica ) blood. Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes exposed to Haemoproteus infected cardinal blood survived significantly fewer days than mosquitoes that ingested Haemoproteus -negative cardinal blood.

Additionally, mosquitoes that fed on canary controls survived significantly fewer days than cardinal negative controls, with canary control mosquitoes having a median survival time of 17\xa0days. This study further supports prior observations that Haemoproteus parasites can be pathogenic to bird-biting mosquitoes, and suggests that Haemoproteus parasites may indirectly suppress the transmission of co-circulating vector-borne pathogens by modulating vector survivorship.

Perceived risks, benefits, and the perception of the technology as tampering with nature were surveyed and were complemented with socio-demographics and a measure of the participants’ moral foundations. In all countries, participants evaluated the application of disease resistance in humans as most right to do, followed by disease resistance in plants, and then in animals, and considered changes in product quality and quantity in cattle as least right to do. However, US and Italian participants were generally more positive toward all scenarios, and German and Austrian participants more negative. Cluster analyses identified four groups of participants: ‘ strong supporters’ who saw only benefits and little risks, ‘ slight supporters’ who perceived risks and valued benefits, ‘ neutrals’ who showed no pronounced opinion, and ‘ opponents’ who perceived higher risks and lower benefits. This research contributes to understanding public response to applications of genome editing, revealing differences that can help guide decisions related to adoption of these technologies.']","['Busch, Gesa, [Ryan, Erin], [Keyserlingk, Marina A.

"['High infection risk is often associated with aggregations of animals around attractive resources. Here, we explore the behavior of potential hosts of non-trophically transmitted parasites at mesocarnivore carcass sites. We used videos recorded by camera traps at 56 red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) carcasses and 10 carcasses of other wild carnivore species in three areas of southeastern Spain. Scavenging species, especially wild canids, mustelids and viverrids, showed more frequent rubbing behavior at carcass sites than non-scavenging and domestic species, suggesting that they could be exposed to a higher potential infection risk. The red fox was the species that most frequently contacted carcasses and marked and rubbed carcass sites. Foxes contacted heterospecific carcasses more frequently and earlier than conspecific ones and, when close contact occurred, it was more likely to be observed at heterospecific carcasses. This suggests that foxes avoid contact with the type of carcass and time period that have the greatest risk as a source of parasites. Overall, non-trophic behaviors of higher infection risk were mainly associated with visitor-carcass contact and visitor contact with feces and urine, rather than direct contact between visitors. Moreover, contact events between scavengers and carnivore carcasses were far more frequent than consumption events, which suggests that scavenger behavior is more constrained by the risk of acquiring meat-borne parasites than non-trophically transmitted parasites. This study contributes to filling key gaps in understanding the role of carrion in the landscape of disgust, which may be especially relevant in the current global context of emerging and re-emerging pathogens.

"['In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape.']","['Conte, Christine E., [Leahy, Jessica E.], [Gardner, Allison M.]']",['10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],[''],['Active Forest Management Reduces Blacklegged Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Exposure Risk']

However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The microscope slides mostly showed piriform and oval merozoites measuring greater than 2.5\xa0µm in length, which were compatible with B. vogeli . However, smaller forms were also identified, thus demonstrating the polymorphic nature of this parasite.

Methods In this field study, households with flea- or tick-infested dog(s) were enrolled on Day 0 into the study to provide data for either the tick or flea infestation cohorts. Households were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the combination investigational product (IP, Credelio Plus ® tablets) or the control product (CP: Nexgard Spectra ® tablets). Dogs were administered IP (flea cohort n \u2009=\u2009135; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u2009147) or CP (flea cohort: n \u2009=\u200967; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u200974) once every 4 weeks for a total of three times at a dose rate of 20.0–41.5\xa0mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner and 0.75–1.53\xa0mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime (IP) or as recommended (CP). Percentage reduction was calculated by comparing individual dog flea and tick counts at each assessed post-treatment time point to their respective baseline (pre-treatment) infestation. Resolution of the clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) was assessed in flea-allergic dogs on the days that flea counts were performed. Results Flea effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® after 3 consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against Ctenocephalides felis , C. canis and Pulex irritans . Tick effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® over the same time frame was 99.3% for Ixodes ricinus and 100% against Rhipicephalus sanguineus ( s.l. ). Flea effectiveness of the CP after three consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against C. felis , C. canis and P. irritans .

"['If a trademark (“mark”) becomes a generic term, it may be cancelled under trademark law, a process known as genericide. Typically, in genericide cases, consumer surveys are brought into evidence to establish a mark’s semantic status as generic or distinctive. Some drawbacks of surveys are cost, delay, small sample size, lack of reproducibility, and observer bias. Today, however, much discourse involving marks is online. As a potential complement to consumer surveys, therefore, we explore an artificial intelligence approach based chiefly on word embeddings: mathematical models of meaning based on distributional semantics that can be trained on texts selected for jurisdictional and temporal relevance. After identifying two main factors in mark genericness, we first offer a simple screening metric based on the ngram frequency of uncapitalized variants of a mark. We then add two word embedding metrics: one addressing contextual similarity of uncapitalized variants, and one comparing the neighborhood density of marks and known generic terms in a category. For clarity and validation, we illustrate our metrics with examples of genericized, somewhat generic, and distinctive marks such as, respectively, DUMPSTER, DOBRO, and ROLEX.']","['Shackell, Cameron, [De Vine, Lance]']",['10.1007/s10506-021-09291-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10506-021-09291-7'],[''],['Quantifying the genericness of trademarks using natural language processing: an introduction with suggested metrics']
"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Animals from the bloodline born between 1962 and 2019 were considered. A total number of 1722 animals were found to be from the line which represents the entire population (WP), including the basic population (BP) and the reference population (RP) defined as the animals currently living. A total of 982 animals were in the RP, with the oldest living dogs born in 2004. A total of 854 dogs were inbred. The average inbreeding coefficient (F) in the RP was 5.1%, while the average inbreeding of the inbred animals was 5.8%. The F was\u2009<\u20090.10 in 711 dogs (77.3% of inbred), and\u2009>\u20090.20 in only 36 dogs (3.91% of inbred). Fifteen traced generations were highlighted. A maximum average inbreeding value (6.45%) was observed in the dogs with 11 traced generations. This research highlighted the good genetic variability of this Australian Cattle Dog bloodline thanks to the efficient management of the breeders who in the past introduced some stallions from abroad. Currently, the lines in Italy are not sufficiently high to prevent inbreeding in the new matings, which is becoming frequent. It is, therefore, important to continue to import new stallions for reproduction to expand the genetic variability. However, at the same time, the old lines need to be preserved genetically, aptitudinally and morphologically, as they are an important heritage of the breed in Italy.""]","['Ciccarelli, Jacopo, [Macchioni, Fabio], [Cecchi, Francesca]']",['10.1007/s12210-021-00993-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-021-00993-3'],[''],['A genealogical survey on the main bloodline of the Australian Cattle Dog in Italy']

"['Purpose of Review In this review, we report on the state of knowledge about human Q fever in Brazil and on the Guiana Shield, an Amazonian region located in northeastern South America. There is a contrast between French Guiana, where the incidence of this disease is the highest in the world, and other countries where this disease is practically non-existent. Recent Findings Recent findings are essentially in French Guiana where a unique strain MST17 has been identified; it is probably more virulent than those usually found with a particularly marked pulmonary tropism, a mysterious animal reservoir, a geographical distribution that raises questions. Summary Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii that has been reported worldwide. On the Guiana Shield, a region mostly covered by Amazonian forest, which encompasses the Venezuelan State of Bolivar, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian State of Amapá, the situation is very heterogeneous. While French Guiana is the region reporting the highest incidence of this disease in the world, with a single infecting clone (MST 117) and a unique epidemiological cycle, it has hardly ever been reported in other countries in the region. This absence of cases raises many questions and is probably due to massive under-diagnosis. Studies should estimate comprehensively the true burden of this disease in the region.']","['Epelboin, Loïc, [Eldin, Carole], [Thill, Pauline], [Santi, Vincent Pommier], [Abboud, Philippe], [Walter, Gaëlle], [Melzani, Alessia], [Letertre-Gibert, Paule], [Perez, Lucas], [Demar, Magalie], [Boutrou, Mathilde], [Fernandes, Jorlan], [Cermeño, Julman Rosiris], [Panizo, Maria Mercedes], [Vreden, Stephen GS], [Djossou, Félix], [Beillard, Emmanuel], [Waard, Jacobus H.], [Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00243-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00243-4'],[''],['Human Q Fever on the Guiana Shield and Brazil: Recent Findings and Remaining Questions']

"['Recent studies directing attention to how people perceive and define politics have provided valuable contributions to our knowledge of what people do and do not think of as politics. Taken together, the results suggest that individuals’ conceptualisations of politics tend to vary. Considerably less is known, however, about how conceptualisations are related to behaviour. This study aims to fill that gap, by testing the hypothesis that those with a wider conception of what constitutes politics are also more likely to participate in political activities. Drawing on data from a survey administered to students at a Swedish University, the key result shows a clear and positive correlation between conceptualisations of politics and political participation, suggesting that the more issues that people perceive as politics, the more likely it is that they are involved in varieties of political participation. Furthermore, the relationship was still present during analyses including other well-known predictors of participation. This indicates that conceptualisations of politics seem to capture variation in individual political participation better than traditional predictors such as political interest, internal political efficacy, and political awareness. It further suggests that perceptions of politics constitute a distinct political orientation, above and beyond these well-known important factors for understanding political participation. Overall, these results are a first indication that future studies of political participation should not neglect. We therefore suggest that the field of political participation should incorporate indicators of both conceptualisations of politics and political participation.']","['Görtz, Carl, [Dahl, Viktor]']",['10.1057/s41304-019-00240-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41304-019-00240-2'],[''],['Perceptions of politics and their implications: exploring the link between conceptualisations of politics and political participation']
"['As the 1951 Refugee Convention advances into its 70 th anniversary, there are mixed feelings as to whether it has lived up to its aspiration. For while it may be hailed as a significant force in the human rights arena (broadly construed), its narrow focus excludes millions who are constantly subjected to various forms of atrocities at the hands of their governments or third parties. Two major concerns to potential asylum seekers, refugee activists and human rights scholars have been the Convention’s conceptualisation of ‘refugee’ and its status determination processes. This duality is demonstrated in the exclusion of ‘disability’ from the international definition of ‘refugee’ and, more specifically, elimination of ‘albinism’ as a humanitarian imperative. Since children with albinism (CwA) are victims of or face constant threats of persecution and there is limited domestic safeguard, the paper argues that the UN Refugee Agency must partner with western countries in resettling these children and similarly situated persons. The focus on CwA is informed by their limited physical strength to ward off their attackers, thereby making them more vulnerable to abduction and related atrocities. By drawing from the USA’ ‘Lost Boys of Sudan’ narrative, the paper concludes that parties to the UN Refugee Convention should introspect on the humanitarian obligation and assist with the evacuation of these endangered children to overcome their current plight.']","['Nkrumah, Bright']",['10.1007/s12134-020-00773-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12134-020-00773-2'],[''],['Anywhere but Here: a Calculus for Protection of Children with Albinism']
"['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites (Arthropoda: Acari) is reviewed within a mechanical model. Trophic access (body size and cheliceral reach) and food morsel handling (chelal gape and estimated static adductive crushing force) are morphologically investigated. Forty-seven commonly occurring astigmatid mite species from 20 genera (covering the Acaridae, Aeroglyphidae, Carpoglyphidae, Chortoglyphidae, Glycyphagidae, Lardoglyphidae, Pyroglyphidae, Suidasiidae, and Winterschmidtiidae) are categorised into functional groups using heuristics. Conclusions are confirmed with statistical tests and multivariate morphometrics. Despite these saprophagous acarines in general being simple ‘shrunken/swollen’ versions of each other, clear statistical correlations in the specifics of their mechanical design (cheliceral and chelal scale and general shape) with the type of habitat and food consumed (their ‘biome’) are found. Using multivariate analyses, macro- and microsaprophagous subtypes are delineated. Relative ratios of sizes on their own are not highly informative of adaptive syndromes. Sympatric resource competition is examined. Evidence for a maximum doubling of approximate body volume within nominal taxa is detected but larger mites are not more ‘generalist’ feeding types. Two contrasting types of basic ‘Bauplan’ are found differing in general scale: (i) a large, chunk-crunching, ‘demolition’-feeding omnivore design (comprising 10 macrosaprophagous astigmatid species), and (ii) a small selective picking, squashing/slicing or fragmentary/‘plankton’ feeding design (which may indicate obligate fungivory/microbivory) comprising 20 microsaprophagous acarid-shaped species. Seventeen other species appear to be specialists. Eleven of these are either: small (interstitial/burrowing) omnivores—or a derived form designed for processing large hard food morsels (debris durophagy, typified by the pyroglyphid Dermatophagoides farinae ), or a specialist sub-type of particular surface gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeding. Six possible other minor specialist gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeders types each comprising one to two species are described. Details of these astigmatid trophic-processing functional groups need field validation and more corroborative comparative enzymology. Chelal velocity ratio in itself is not highly predictive of habitat but with cheliceral aspect ratio (or chelal adductive force) is indicative of life-style. Herbivores and pest species are typified by a predicted large chelal adductive force. Pest species may be ‘shredders’ derived from protein-seeking necrophages. Carpoglyphus lactis typifies a mite with tweezer-like chelae of very feeble adductive force. It is suggested that possible zoophagy (hypocarnivory) is associated with low chelal adductive force together with a small or large gape depending upon the size of the nematode being consumed. Kuzinia laevis typifies an oophagous durophage. Functional form is correlated with taxonomic position within the Astigmata—pyroglyphids and glycyphagids being distinct from acarids. A synthesis with mesostigmatid and oribatid feeding types is offered together with clarification of terminologies. The chelal lyrifissure in the daintiest chelicerae of these astigmatids is located similar to where the action of the chelal moveable digit folds the cheliceral shaft in uropodoids, suggesting mechanical similarities of function. Acarid astigmatids are trophically structured like microphytophagous/fragmentary feeding oribatids. Some larger astigmatids ( Aleuroglyphus ovatus , Kuzinia laevis , Tyroborus lini ) approximate, and Neosuidasia sp. matches, the design of macrophytophagous oribatids. Most astigmatid species reviewed appear to be positioned with other oribatid secondary decomposers. Only Dermatophagoides microceras might be a primary decomposer approximating a lichenivorous oribatid ( Austrachipteria sp.) in trophic form. Astigmatid differences are consilient with the morphological trend from micro- to macrophytophagy in oribatids. The key competency in these actinotrichid mites is a type of ‘gnathosomisation’ through increased chelal and cheliceral height (i.e., a shape change that adjusts the chelal input effort arm and input adductive force) unrestricted by the dorsal constraint of a mesostigmatid-like gnathotectum. A predictive nomogram for ecologists to use on field samples is included. Future work is proposed in detail.']","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],[''],['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites']

"['Transmembrane conductance of small uncharged solutes such as glycerol typically occurs through aquaglyceroporins (Glps), which are commonly encoded by multiple genes in metazoan organisms. To date, however, little is known concerning the evolution of Glps in Crustacea or what forces might underly such apparent gene redundancy. Here, we show that Glp evolution in Crustacea is highly divergent, ranging from single copy genes in species of pedunculate barnacles, tadpole shrimps, isopods, amphipods and decapods to up to 10 copies in diplostracan water fleas although with monophyletic origins in each lineage. By contrast the evolution of Glps in Copepoda appears to be polyphyletic, with surprisingly high rates of gene duplication occurring in a genera- and species-specific manner. Based upon functional experiments on the Glps from a parasitic copepod ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ), we show that such lineage-level gene duplication and splice variation is coupled with a high rate of neofunctionalization. In the case of L. salmonis , splice variation of a given gene resulted in tissue- or sex-specific expression of the channels, with each variant evolving unique sites for protein kinase C (PKC)- or protein kinase A (PKA)-regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking. The combined data sets thus reveal that mutations favouring a high fidelity control of intracellular trafficking regulation can be a selection force for the evolution and retention of multiple Glps in copepods. Marc Catalán-Garcia et al. examine evolutionary divergence of aquaglyceroporins (GLPs) in copepods, observing that these genes are subject to high rates of gene duplication across species. They also report tissue- and sex-specific expression of GLP splice variants in the parasitic copepod, L. salmonis, that in turn exhibit PKA- or PKC-dependent changes in membrane trafficking. Altogether, these results suggest that mutations in GLP genes with precise regulation of intracellular tracking may be related to neofunctionalization in these species.']","['Catalán-García, Marc, [Chauvigné, François], [Stavang, Jon Anders], [Nilsen, Frank], [Cerdà, Joan], [Finn, Roderick Nigel]']",['10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],[''],['Lineage-level divergence of copepod glycerol transporters and the emergence of isoform-specific trafficking regulation']

Methods In this 11-month field study, 319 dogs\u2009≥\u20098\xa0weeks old confirmed to be heartworm-negative were enrolled from eight geographically distinct US veterinary clinics, including sites in the southern USA and Mississippi River Valley. The dogs were treated with either the IP combination product at 0.75–1.53\xa0mg/kg milbemycin oxime and 20–41.5\xa0mg/kg lotilaner ( n \u2009=\u2009159) or the CP (Sentinel ® Flavor Tabs ® ; milbemycin oxime/lufenuron) at the label-recommended dose rate ( n \u2009=\u2009158.)

Results All dogs treated with the IP combination product and the CP tested negative (100% prevention) for heartworm infection on day 330. The IP combination product tablets containing milbemycin oxime and lotilaner were well tolerated based on the safety assessments in all treated dogs. Conclusions This multi-site clinical study using client-owned dogs demonstrated that monthly use of flavored, chewable tablets containing a combination of milbemycin oxime and lotilaner administered orally under end use conditions is safe for dogs.

"['Developing general principles of host–microorganism interactions necessitates a robust understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes that structure microbiota. Phylosymbiosis, or patterns of microbiome composition that can be predicted by host phylogeny, is a unique framework for interrogating these processes. Identifying the contexts in which phylosymbiosis does and does not occur facilitates an evaluation of the relative importance of different ecological processes in shaping the microbial community. In this Review, we summarize the prevalence of phylosymbiosis across the animal kingdom on the basis of the current literature and explore the microbial community assembly processes and related host traits that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We find that phylosymbiosis is less prevalent in taxonomically richer microbiomes and hypothesize that this pattern is a result of increased stochasticity in the assembly of complex microbial communities. We also note that despite hosting rich microbiomes, mammals commonly exhibit phylosymbiosis. We hypothesize that this pattern is a result of a unique combination of mammalian traits, including viviparous birth, lactation and the co-evolution of haemochorial placentas and the eutherian immune system, which compound to ensure deterministic microbial community assembly. Examining both the individual and the combined importance of these traits in driving phylosymbiosis provides a new framework for research in this area moving forward.

"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

In order to do so, I will borrow from the terminology employed in recent debates in the philosophy of evil which have tackled a similar problem to the one at hand, i.e. defining what sets evil apart from ordinary wrongdoing. Here it has been argued that concepts could be distinct in three ways: they can have a quantitative difference, a strong qualitative or a moderate qualitative difference.

"['Purpose of Review Increasing attention has been paid in recent decades to social determinants of health as a risk factor for disease development and disease severity. While traditionally heart disease, family history, lipid profile, and tobacco use have all been associated with increased risk of neurological disease, numerous studies now show that the influence of poverty may be just as strong a risk factor. This study summarizes the recent literature on poverty as it contributes to neurological disease. Recent Findings Children growing up in poverty have increased risk for cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders as reported by Noble et al. (Dev Sci. 9(6):642–54, 2006) and Farah et al. (Brain Res. 1110(1):166–74, 2006) as well as worse outcomes when it comes to epilepsy management and disease course as discussed by Camfield et al. (Epilepsia. 57(11):1826–33, 2016). In adulthood, as the number of social determinants of health increases, the incidence of stroke and severe stroke increases significantly as reported by Reshetnyak et al. (Stroke. 51:2445–53, 2020) as does exposure to neurologically significant infectious diseases and incidence of dementia as reported by Sumilo et al.

Summary Social determinants of health including poverty should be considered a risk factor for disease.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"
"['In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country.

"[""A model based upon mechanics is used in a re-analysis of historical acarine morphological work augmented by an extra seven zoophagous mesostigmatid species. This review shows that predatory mesostigmatids do have cheliceral designs with clear rational purposes. Almost invariably within an overall body size class, the switch in predatory style from a worm-like prey feeding (‘crushing/mashing’ kill) functional group to a micro-arthropod feeding (‘active prey cutting/slicing/slashing' kill) functional group is matched by: an increased cheliceral reach, a bigger chelal gape, a larger morphologically estimated chelal crunch force, and a drop in the adductive lever arm velocity ratio of the chela. Small size matters. Several uropodines ( Eviphis ostrinus , the omnivore Trachytes aegrota , Urodiaspis tecta and, Uropoda orbicularis ) have more elongate chelicerae (greater reach) than their chelal gape would suggest, even allowing for allometry across mesostigmatids. They may be: plesiosaur-like high-speed strikers of prey, scavenging carrion feeders (like long-necked vultures), probing/burrowing crevice feeders of cryptic nematodes, or small morsel/fragmentary food feeders. Some uropodoids have chelicerae and chelae which probably work like a construction-site mechanical excavator-digger with its small bucket. Possible hoeing/bulldozing, spore-cracking and tiny sabre-tooth cat-like striking actions are discussed for others. Subtle changes lead small mesostigmatids to be predator–scavengers (mesocarnivores) or to be predator–fungivores (hypocarnivores). Some uropodines (e.g., the worm-like prey feeder Alliphis siculus and, Uropoda orbicularis ) show chelae similar in design to astigmatids and cryptostigmatids indicating possible facultative saprophagy. Scale matters—obligate predatory designs (hypercarnivory) start for mesostigmatids with chelal gape > 150 μm and cheliceral reach > 350 μm (i.e., about 500–650 μm in body size). Commonality of trophic design in these larger species with solifugids is indicated. Veigaia species with low chelal velocity ratio and other morphological strengthening specialisms, appear specially adapted in a concerted way for predating active soft and fast moving springtails (Collembola). Veigaia cerva shows a markedly bigger chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would proportionately infer suggesting it is a crocodile-like sit-and-wait or ambush predator par excellence . A small chelal gape, low cheliceral reach, moderate velocity ratio variant of the worm-like feeding habit design is supported for phytoseiid pollenophagy. Evidence for a resource partitioning model in the evolution of gnathosomal development is found. A comparison to crustacean claws and vertebrate mandibles is made. Alliphis siculus and Rhodacarus strenzkei are surprisingly powerful mega-cephalics for their small size. Parasitids show a canid-like trophic design. The chelicera of the nematophagous Alliphis halleri shows felid-like features. Glyphtholaspis confusa has hyaena-like cheliceral dentition. The latter species has a markedly smaller chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would suggest proportionately, which together with a high chelal velocity ratio and a high estimated chelal crunch force matches a power specialism of feeding on immobile tough fly eggs/pupae by crushing (durophagy). A consideration of gnathosomal orientation is made. Predatory specialisms appear to often match genera especially in larger mesostigmatids, which may scale quite differently. Comparison to holothyrids and opilioacarids indicates that the cheliceral chelae of the former are cutting-style and those of the latter are crushing-style. A simple validated easy-to-use ‘2:1 on’ predictive algorithm of feeding habit type is included based on a strength-speed tradeoff in chelal velocity ratio for ecologists to test in the field.""]","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],[''],['Feeding design in free-living mesostigmatid chelicerae (Acari: Anactinotrichida)']

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

"['The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae , is a significant ectoparasite of penguins in Antarctica and of other seabirds, mainly in coastal, polar regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but the tick’s distribution extends into more temperate regions as well. The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built.

Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s).

Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens.

"['Nile tilapia is an important economically farmed fish worldwide, and Streptococcus agalactiae has become the most serious disease problem for the tilapia industry in China. Therefore, a better understanding of the innate immune mechanisms and their functions in the context of pathogen invasion is needed. In this study, a high-throughput proteomic strategy was developed for determining the differential expression proteins (DEPs) of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) (susceptible and resistant GIFT species) splenic responses to S. agalactiae infection. The results showed 1608 proteins were identified with high confidence ( P < 0.05). A total of 441 and 382 DEPs were characterized in susceptible and resistant GIFT tilapia species, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) annotation showed that the DEPs covered many biological functions, including cellular process, metabolism, and immune process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly enriched in the lysosome, apoptosis, and complement and coagulation cascade pathways during S. agalactiae infection. By group comparisons, the proteins related to immune response, cytoskeleton, and energy metabolism of disease-resistant strains were upregulated compared with those of susceptible strain. The content determination of immune-related enzyme activity was consistent with the results obtained throughout the study. More active innate immune system and cell defense is the basis of S. agalactiae resistance for disease-resistant GIFT tilapia species. Furthermore, 34 proteins involved in disease resistance were characterized. Therefore, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the immune system and defense mechanisms of GIFT tilapia in response to S. agalactiae infection and provides valuable recommendations for breeding disease-resistant GIFT tilapia species.']","['Zhu, Jiajie, [Yu, Kai], [Ao, Qiuwei], [Tan, Yun], [Fu, Qiang], [Jiang, Hesheng]']",['10.1007/s10499-021-00683-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00683-9'],[''],['Comparative splenic proteomic analysis of susceptible and resistant GIFT tilapia following challenge with Streptococcus agalactiae']
"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background Theileria orientalis is a tick-borne hemoparasite that causes anemia, ill thrift, and death in cattle globally. The Ikeda strain of T. orientalis is more virulent than other strains, leading to severe clinical signs and death of up to 5% of affected animals. Within the Asia–Pacific region, where it affects 25% of Australian cattle, T. orientalis Ikeda has a significant economic impact on the cattle industry. In 2017, T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in a cattle herd in Albermarle County, Virginia, United States. Months earlier, the U.S. was alerted to the invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, throughout the eastern U.S. Abundant H. longicornis ticks were identified on cattle in the T. orientalis- affected herd in VA, and a subset of ticks from the environment were PCR-positive for T. orientalis Ikeda. A strain of T. orientalis from a previous U.S. outbreak was not transmissible by H. longicornis ; however, H. longicornis is the primary tick vector of T. orientalis Ikeda in other regions of the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether invasive H. longicornis ticks in the U.S. are competent vectors of T. orientalis Ikeda. Methods Nymphal H. longicornis ticks were fed on a splenectomized calf infected with the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. After molting, a subset of adult ticks from this cohort were dissected, and salivary glands assayed for T. orientalis Ikeda via qPCR. The remaining adult ticks from the group were allowed to feed on three calves. Calves were subsequently monitored for T. orientalis Ikeda infection via blood smear cytology and PCR. Results After acquisition feeding on a VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda-infected calf as nymphs, a subset of molted adult tick salivary glands tested positive by qPCR for T. orientalis Ikeda. Adult ticks from the same cohort successfully transmitted T. orientalis Ikeda to 3/3 naïve calves, each of which developed parasitemia reaching 0.4–0.9%. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that U.S. H. longicornis ticks are competent vectors of the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. This data provides important information for the U.S. cattle industry regarding the potential spread of this parasite and the necessity of enhanced surveillance and control measures.']","['Dinkel, Kelcey D., [Herndon, David R.], [Noh, Susan M.], [Lahmers, Kevin K.], [Todd, S.

"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']

Seven tick species are known to feed on bare-nosed wombats ( Vombatus ursinus ), in addition to the highly prevalent Sarcoptes scabiei mite which causes fatal sarcoptic mange in most bare-nosed wombat populations. Little is known about the pathogens carried by most wombat ticks or how they may impact wombats and wombat handlers. Methods Wombat ticks were sourced from wildlife hospitals and sanctuaries across Australia and identified to species level using taxonomic keys. Genomic DNA was extracted from a subsample, and following the amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3–V4 hypervariable region, next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform was used to assess the microbial composition. Results A total of 447 tick specimens were collected from 47 bare-nosed wombats between January 2019 and January 2020. Five species of ticks were identified comprising wombat tick Bothriocroton auruginans ( n = 420), wallaby tick Haemaphysalis bancrofti ( n = 8), bush tick Haemaphysalis longicornis ( n = 3), common marsupial tick Ixodes tasmani ( n = 12), and Australian paralysis tick Ixodes holocyclus ( n = 4). Tick infestations ranged from one to 73 ticks per wombat. The wombat tick was the most prevalent tick species comprising 94% of the total number of samples and was present on 97.9% (46/47) of wombat hosts. NGS results revealed the 16S rRNA gene diversity profile was predominantly Proteobacteria (55.1%) followed by Firmicutes (21.9%) and Actinobacteria (18.4%).

In contrast, in our preliminary survey of the field collected adult lone star ticks, we found the number of culturable/viable bacteria very low. Methods We aimed to analyze the bacterial community of A. americanum by a parallel culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach applied to individual ticks. Results We analyzed 94 adult females collected in eastern Kansas and found that 60.8% of ticks had no culturable bacteria and the remaining ticks carried only 67.7\u2009±\u200942.8 colony-forming units (CFUs)/tick representing 26 genera.

Therefore, a study was carried out to determine the prevalence of ectoparasites of wild game in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria. Physical examinations were carried out on 143 wildlife, and laboratory identification was employed on the ectoparasites. The collected ectoparasites were identified in the laboratory using literature and with the help of a taxonomist. Results Out of the 143 game examined, 114 was infected with at least one parasite representing about 98.6% of an infestation. Among the parasites identified, Amblyomma spp . showed the highest prevalence of 24.5% at 95% confidential intervals of CI (1.45–3.19)–24.5% ( p \u2009≤\u20090.05). No difference was observed in the prevalence of the ectoparasites according to sex, except for Ixodes holocyclus. Similarly, no difference was observed in prevalence with reference to age except for Rhipicephalus spp . and Polyplax spinulosa which showed differences. Conclusions The present study provides basic data about the most prevalent ectoparasitic arthropod among game in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria, which requires an evaluation of its zoonotic control measures. This work can elicit the risk of possible transmission of some zoonotic and enzootic diseases via game. Improving awareness among local people and bushmeat dealers about the risk of contracting a vector-borne disease through wildlife is crucial.']","['Ozioko, Kingsley Uchenna, [Okoye, Chris Ikem], [Ubachukwu, Patience Obiageli], [Agbu, Raymond Awudu], [Ezewudo, Bede Izuchukwu], [Ezea, Celestine Osita]']",['10.1186/s42269-020-00461-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42269-020-00461-2'],[''],"['Prevalence assessment of ectoparasitic arthropods among commonly consumed wildlife in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria']"
"['Ticks are well known as vectors of many viruses which usually do great harm to human and animal health. Yunnan Province, widely covered by flourishing vegetation and mainly relying on farming husbandry, is abundant with Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the viral profile present in R. microplus parasitizing on cattle in Yunnan Province. In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan. These viruses consist of single-stranded, circular and segmented sense RNAs, showing a greatly diversity in genomic organization. Furthermore, continuous epidemiological survey among ticks reveals broad prevalence of three viruses (Yunnan mivirus 1, Wuhan tick vrius 1 and YN tick-associated phlebovirus 1) and two possible prevalent viruses including a flavivirus-like segmented virus (Jingmen tick virus) and a bovine hokovirus 2 in Yunnan. Serological investigation among cattle indicates that these identified viruses may be infectious to cattle and can elicit corresponding antibody. Our findings on R. microplus -associated viral community will contribute to the prevention of viral disease and tracking the viral evolution. Further analysis is needed to better elucidate the pathogenicity and natural circulation of these viruses.']","['Shi, Junming, [Shen, Shu], [Wu, Hui], [Zhang, Yunzhi], [Deng, Fei]']",['10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x'],[''],"['Metagenomic Profiling of Viruses Associated with Rhipicephalus microplus Ticks in Yunnan Province, China']"
"['Rickettsia is an infectious disease, caused by a small obligate intracellular gram-negative bacillus, which is transmitted to humans by blood-borne arthropods such as ticks, lice, mites, and fleas. It has a worldwide distribution, as an emerging and re-emerging febrile illness, accompanied by rash and eschar; its diagnosis is difficult, since its confirmation is made after the acute febrile episode, through serological tests. The suspicion of this infection should be high, since timely antibiotic treatment can lead to rapid clinical improvement. It is a life-threatening infection, with pulmonary manifestations, acute kidney injury, gangrene, and neurological manifestations such as delirium, seizures, stupor, and coma. During pregnancy, this infection can cause maternal mortality, with a high frequency of complications such as stillbirth, prematurity, and low birth weight. The use of the tetracyclines group, specifically doxycycline, is preferred as the first line, due to its efficacy and low toxicity to the mother as well as child, the use of quinolones remaining in the second line.

"['Cloth-dragging is the most widely-used method for collecting and counting ticks, but there are few studies of its reliability. By using cloth-dragging, we applied a replicated line transects survey method, in two areas in Sweden with different Ixodes ricinus tick-densities (low at Grimsö and high at Bogesund) to evaluate developmental stage specific repeatability, agreement and precision in estimates of tick abundance. ‘Repeatability’ was expressed as the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), ‘agreement’ with the Total Deviation Index (TDI) and ‘precision’ by the coefficient of variation (CV) for a given dragging distance. Repeatability (ICC) and agreement (TDI) were higher for the most abundant instar (nymphs) and in the area of higher abundance. At Bogesund tick counts were higher than at Grimsö and so also repeatability, with fair to substantial ICC estimates between 0.22 and 0.75, and TDI ranged between 1 and 44.5 counts of difference (thus high to moderate agreement). At Grimsö, ICC was poor to moderate and ranged between 0 and 0.59, whereas TDI remained low with estimates lower or equal to 1 count (thus high agreement). Despite a 100-fold lower abundance at Grimsö, the same level of precision for nymphs could be achieved with a 70% increase of dragging effort.

We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"['Objectives Although there are promising studies on cancer treatment, it is still a frightening disease. For effective treatment, an integrative and positive perspective is required. Using the power of metaphors to facilitate understanding of complex and intangible ideas, this study aims to define cancer from the perspective of Turkish nursing students. Sample and Setting This study was conducted with 166 nursing students at a nursing faculty in Turkey. It was a mixed method study using qualitative and quantitative methods. Methods and Variables To capture the picture in a human mind of the complexity of feelings for cancer, writing a description and elicitation interviews were employed. Moreover, to reach ontological and epistemological level thoughts in the deepest layers of elicited metaphors, the data were analyzed in an analytical framework. Results The study provides a conceptualization of ""Cancer."" The students produced 92 valid metaphors. The most commonly used metaphors were found to be ‘death\', ‘war\', ‘a virus\', ‘a malady\' and ‘a spider\'. It was found that the metaphors produced by the students on the concept of cancer generally used negative themes.

"['Purpose Choir singing is an important tradition of Christian worship across India. However, vocal health issues related to the church choir singers are less addressed in the literature. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vocal symptoms, identify the variables associated with increased risk of voice problems and knowledge of factors influencing vocal health in church choir singers. Method One hundred and forty-eight church choir singers (61 males and 85 females) between the age range of 18 and 70\xa0years participated in the study. They completed a self-reported questionnaire addressing demographic and singing-related details, vocal symptoms, variables associated with increased risk reporting voice problems and knowledge about factors influencing vocal health. Result Eighty-four percent of the choir singers reported two or more vocal symptoms sometimes or more frequently while or after singing. More than half of the church choir singers had experienced vocal symptoms such as accessing notes in the upper range, loss of vocal endurance, pitch breaks, hoarseness, dryness in the throat, and discomfort in the throat. Among the different variables, systemic hydration found to have a significant association with reporting of voice problems in church choir singers. The overall knowledge regarding the factors influencing vocal health was found to be limited among the choir singers. Conclusion Choir singers like other professional singers experienced a higher prevalence of vocal symptoms during or after singing and exhibited limited knowledge about factors that negatively influence vocal health.

Experiments are performed over four publicly available databases, i.e., MSR Daily Activity 3D Dataset, UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset, KARD- Kinect Activity Recognition Dataset, and SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset, and proved that proposed descriptor outperforms as a comparison to state-of-the-art approaches on entire four datasets.

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions. Inviting leadership from local HCWs may increase the likelihood of delivery plans that account for unique local context and structural barriers researchers may otherwise struggle to uncover.""]","['Asabor, Emmanuella Ngozi, [Lett, Elle], [Moll, Anthony], [Shenoi, Sheela V.]']",['10.1007/s10461-021-03213-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03213-z'],[''],"[""“We’ve Got Our Own Beliefs, Attitudes, Myths”: A Mixed Methods Assessment of Rural South African Health Care Workers' Knowledge of\xa0and Attitudes Towards PrEP Implementation""]"

"['Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a virus called “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).” In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85).

Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']

The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ). Probability density functions of the total derivative from convective cases show mean volumetric heating rates of 43 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 (154 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) compared to 13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 (47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) on non-convective days. A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings. Of the cases examined, 83% with streamwise and 81% with spanwise advection during unstable periods are classified as locally driven by nearby surface thermal heterogeneities.']","['Morrison, Travis, [Calaf, Marc], [Higgins, Chad W.], [Drake, Stephen A.], [Perelet, Alexei], [Pardyjak, Eric]']",['10.1007/s10546-021-00624-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-021-00624-2'],[''],['The Impact of Surface Temperature Heterogeneity on Near-Surface Heat Transport']
"['Evidence-based parenting programs have shown efficacy across a range of contexts, however, the cultural fit of a program can affect program engagement and participation. Ensuring the acceptability of programs and strategies is essential prior to wider dissemination. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to assess the acceptability of Group Triple P with Brazilian parents. A cross-sectional design was used with a sample of convenience ( n \u2009=\u200938 Brazilian parents) who had completed Triple P as a part of another study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from these parents in order to explore their perceptions of the program and its strategies. The quantitative outcomes revealed the participants found the strategies highly acceptable and highly useful and were moderately satisfied with the program. The most common barriers identified by parents to accessing the program were logistical (e.g., access to childcare, and competing work commitments) and emotional (e.g., shame for parents) rather than cultural barriers. A thematic analysis of qualitative responses revealed four major themes: recommendations for program implementation, cultural appropriateness, barriers to implementing Triple P and changes in parenting. Overall, the participants were very positive about Triple P and perceived the program to be consistent with the cultural values of Brazilian parents, however, some recommendations to improve cultural fit were noted. Group Triple P was viewed as acceptable and useful by Brazilian parents. More research examining Triple P in Brazil is warranted. Barriers to access the program were investigated, these appear to be similar to other countries and not unique to Brazil. The results add to the growing evidence suggesting that Triple P is acceptable across cultures.']","['Schulz, Mariajose L.

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Objectives Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), as a malignancy marker, is overly expressed in multiple solid tumors including colorectal neoplasms, one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). Whereas the cytotoxicity of C-CUS 245C could hardly be detected on EGFR-null cell line. Our results also showed that C-CUS 245C had efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer in mouse xenograft model, indicating the therapeutic potential of C-CUS 245C for the targeted therapy of colorectal neoplasms. Conclusions C-CUS 245C exhibits potent and EGFR-specific cytotoxicity. Insertional mutagenesis technique is worthy to be adopted in the preparation of immunotoxin. Immunotoxin can be highly purified through dialysis followed by IMAC.']","['Wu, Shuifa, [Deng, Cuimin], [Zhang, Caiyun], [Xiong, Jiani], [Gu, Xiaofan], [Wang, Ze], [Tu, Jingjing], [Xie, Jieming]']",['10.1007/s12094-020-02548-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02548-8'],[''],['Preparation of a novel EGFR specific immunotoxin and its efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

Likewise, in Mauritius, a regulation banning the use of plastic bags was introduced in 2016. Whether this regulation has been successful in stopping the usage of banned plastic bags or not, is the overall objective of the present study. The study was conducted on the Mauritian population. It equally investigated: the quantity of plastic bags utilized before and after regulation; the alternatives to plastic bags used; the level of awareness on environmental and health impacts resulting from indiscriminate disposal of plastic bags; and the perception of the regulation. 65% of the respondent population claimed that the regulation has failed to prohibit the usage of banned plastic bags.

The current study was designed to assess the influence of a week-long, academically interdisciplinary spatial reasoning Bootcamp on a small, diverse group of female participants’ spatial reasoning abilities and to determine if Participants’ subsequent performance in organic chemistry and physics coursework differed from that of a Match (non-Bootcamp participant) Control group. The data indicate that Bootcamp participants significantly improved their scores in some commonly accepted measures of spatial reasoning abilities and that Bootcamp participants’ final grades in organic chemistry, but not physics, were significantly higher than the Match Control group.

Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of: sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments. We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in Practice to characterize the PSTs’ perceptions of their experience of formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students, in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on average less confidence in assessing school student task responses themselves than in assessing peer work.

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"

Both individuals were positively food-conditioned and showed increasing habituation caused by irresponsible behaviour of people such as long-lasting intentional feeding or illegal keeping.

A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']

"['Babesia orientalis , belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, is mainly accountable for water buffalo babesiosis, which adversely affected the livestock industry in China. Variant erythrocyte surface antigen-1 (VESA1), an antigen that helps infected erythrocytes to escape from host immune responses, was first reported in Babesia bovis. Various VESA1 proteins have also been characterized in other Babesia species. Nevertheless, there is no research on the identification and characterization of VESA1 proteins in Babesia orientalis. In this study, the BoVESA1 gene was amplified from both gDNA and cDNA. The results revealed that it is an intronless gene with a full length of 753\xa0bp, encoding a protein of 250 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 28\xa0kDa. The coding sequence (CDS) was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector using a homologous recombination kit and expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein with a molecular weight of 53\xa0kDa. The tertiary structure of BoVESA1 was predicted using the I-TASSER software. The recombinant protein was subjected to western blotting; the immunogenicity of recombinant BoVESA1 (rBoVESA1) was identified by incubating it with B. orientalis -positive serum. The native BoVESA1 was identified using the lysates of B. orientalis -infected water buffalo erythrocytes incubated with the anti-rBoVESA1 mouse serum. The results showed a band of\u2009~\u200928\xa0kDa, which is similar to the predicted size. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-rBoVESA1 serum probed indicated a strong signal in the infected RBCs, while the negative control showed no signal.

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

We conducted a cross-sectional study combining serological and molecular tests to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp. infections in dogs in two hyperendemic foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately owned dogs (417 from Goiana municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, and 213 from São Joaquim de Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil) were sampled and molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall, 519 dogs (82.4%) presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity was significantly higher in dogs older than 1\xa0year.

"['Cattle ranching is one of the main production activities in the Neotropics that has unavoidably led to cattle exposure to the common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) and rabies virus. Although many studies have assessed this issue, the influence of environmental characteristics associated with land use and social and production constraints have received little attention. We used satellite imagery classification to identify a gradient of landscape disturbance and analyzed the effects of cattle management and landscape structure on common vampire bat abundance and feeding prevalence. Evidence of the common vampire bat feeding on cattle was common in the study area: 87.5% of the ranchers interviewed claimed to have experienced this problem. The abundance and feeding prevalence of the common vampire bat was lower in landscapes dominated by open fields, scarce forest cover, and agricultural land. Bat abundance was positively associated with the presence of streams in the proximity of grazing areas, whereas cave’s presence was associated with higher feeding prevalence. We suggest that cattle grazing should avoid the proximity of streams, caves, and forests as much as possible, as these conditions increase the exposure of cattle to the common vampire bat and the potential for feeding, which can increase the likelihood of rabies virus transmission.']","['Mendoza-Sáenz, Víctor Hugo, [Navarrete-Gutiérrez, Darío Alejandro], [Jiménez-Ferrer, Guillermo], [Kraker-Castañeda, Cristian], [Saldaña-Vázquez, Romeo A.]']",['10.1007/s13364-021-00572-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-021-00572-9'],[''],['Abundance of the common vampire bat and feeding prevalence on cattle along a gradient of landscape disturbance in southeastern Mexico']
"['Background Bovine tropical theileriosis (BTT) is a haemoprotozoan tick-borne disease that implicates huge losses to livestock in terms of considerable mortality and morbidity in tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. Currently available diagnostic methods have less specificity and sensitivity towards the detection of Theileria species. Therefore, an attempt was made to diagnose Theileria annulata by targeting a multi-copy gene, viz. mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b (MT-CYB) gene via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different agro-zones of India. Methods and Results 129 cattle blood samples were collected from major livestock rearing regions of India and processed for both molecular and microscopic techniques. Screening of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears was able to detect 14 samples (10.85%) as positive for T. annulata. However, the MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay detected 107 samples (82.94%) positive for T. annulata out of 129 samples. Furthermore, the MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay was standardized in terms of its sensitivity and specificity. Specificity of PCR assay was evaluated against other common haemoprotozoan parasites of tropical countries viz. Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Trypanosoma evansi . The multi-copy MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay provided an optimum level of sensitivity (up to the level of 10 femtogram) and high specificity. Haematological examination (Hb, PCV and TLC) of 113 samples revealed significantly ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) decreased Hb and PCV levels in positive animals in comparison with the control group of healthy animals. However, the control group had significantly higher ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) TLC levels than the positive group.

Trypanosoma evansi infection was confirmed by microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Non-infected clinically healthy dogs ( n \u2009=\u20096) served as control. Blood samples were collected to study the haemogram and serum samples were used for the evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and oxidant-antioxidant parameters . Results During the study period, an overall incidence of 0.25% was recorded for trypanosomosis in dogs. The most consistent clinical findings noticed were anorexia/inappetence, pyrexia, depression/lethargy, pale mucous membrane, dehydration and lymphadenomegaly. Anaemia, granulocytopenia, lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia were the major findings noticed in trypanosomosis affected dogs. The profile of vital organ function revealed that the mean values of total protein, albumin and random blood glucose were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower, whereas the mean values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher in dogs affected with trypanosomosis.

"['Purpose Ehrlichiosis is one of the tick-borne diseases, which is not only neglected in Pakistan but only a few reports have been documented throughout the globe. The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease.

"['Background Improved knowledge on vector-borne pathogens in wildlife will help determine their effect on host species at the population and individual level and whether these are affected by anthropogenic factors such as global climate change and landscape changes. Here, samples from brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea ) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA ( n \u2009=\u200917), SHNA ( n \u2009=\u200919) and SHTZ ( n \u2009=\u200925) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau -like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum / platys -like and Anaplasma bovis -like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau -like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli -like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis -like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1–4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2–4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0–4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia , multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group. Ecological conditions explained pathogen identity and diversity better than host taxonomy.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The microscope slides mostly showed piriform and oval merozoites measuring greater than 2.5\xa0µm in length, which were compatible with B. vogeli . However, smaller forms were also identified, thus demonstrating the polymorphic nature of this parasite.

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world.

"['Background The speed with which acaricides paralyze and kill ticks is relevant to impeding pathogen transmission. The objective of this study was to assess early-onset lotilaner effects on the motility and weights of Amblyomma americanum ticks collected from treated dogs. Methods Twelve healthy dogs were randomized between two groups to receive either lotilaner (Credelio ® ) on Day 0 or to be sham treated. On Day 7, 25 male and 25 female A. americanum were placed under bandages, two on each flank of each dog. After 30 or 45\xa0min, all unattached ticks were removed and T \u2009=\u20090 was set. At T \u2009=\u20092, 4, 8 and 24\xa0h post attachment, 5 attached ticks removed from each bandage on each dog were weighed, assessed by blinded observers for righting ability and movement recorded. Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean tick weights from the treated group were significantly lower at 24\xa0h than at earlier time points ( P male \u2009<\u20090.0307; P female \u2009=\u20090.0021). At 4 and 8\xa0h, significantly fewer ticks from treated (14.3%, 0.0%, respectively) than from control dogs could right (73.3%, 70.0%) ( P 4h \u2009<\u20090.0001; P 8h \u2009=\u20090.0024) (at 24\xa0h, all ticks from treated dogs were dead), and distance moved was significantly less at all time points ( P 2h \u2009=\u20090.0413; P 4h , P 8h \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean and maximum velocity of ticks from treated dogs were significantly lower, relative to controls, at 4 and 8\xa0h ( P \u2009≤\u20090.0001). Within the treated group, collected ticks had significantly lower mean and maximum velocities at 4 and 8\xa0h compared to 2\xa0h ( P mean \u2009<\u20090.0042; P max \u2009<\u20090.0194).

Those irreversible changes could substantially reduce the risk of pathogen transmission from tick to host.']","['Wenger, Martha J., [Kollasch, Todd M.], [Burke, Madeline C.], [Jones, Livvy], [Locklear, Casey], [Hedberg, Makaela], [Miller, Lauren], [Reeves, Sydnie], [Ritchie, Debra], [Rumschlag, Anthony J.], [Ryan, William G.], [Smith, Vicki], [Sutherland, Cameron], [Reif, Kathryn E.], [Herrin, Brian H.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04817-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04817-z'],[''],['Early onset of pre-lethal effects of lotilaner (Credelio®) on Amblyomma americanum ticks on experimentally infested dogs']
"['Background Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and is highly lethal in humans and dogs if left untreated. The frequency of this parasite and associated histological changes in the pancreas of dogs are poorly studied. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency of detection and load of amastigotes in the pancreas of L. infantum -seropositive dogs and to identify the clinical signs and histological changes associated with parasitism of this organ. Methods One hundred forty-three dogs from an endemic area in Brazil that tested seropositive for L. infantum were studied. The dogs were clinically examined, killed, and necropsied between 2013 and 2014. One fragment of the pancreas was randomly collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry, and spleen and bone marrow were collected for culture. Results Leishmania amastigotes were detected in the pancreas of 22 dogs (15.4%) by immunohistochemistry, all exhibiting L. infantum parasitism in the spleen and/or bone marrow. Poor body condition and cachexia were only associated with infection of the pancreas with Leishmania spp. ( p \u2009=\u20090.021) and were found in 40.9% of dogs with pancreatic infection. Anorexia, vomiting, and/or diarrhea were observed in 9.2% of dogs with pancreatitis. The median parasite load in the pancreas was 1.4 infected macrophages/mm 2 . Pancreatic histological changes and their frequencies were: granulomatous pancreatitis (28.0%), lymphoplasmacytic pancreatitis (23.8%), acinar cell degeneration (6.3%), fibrosis (5.6%), hemorrhage (2.1%), eosinophilic pancreatitis (0.7%), suppurative pancreatitis (0.7%), and necrosis (0.7%). Conclusions The present results demonstrate that L. infantum is one of the etiological agents of chronic pancreatitis in dogs; however, the frequency of detection and parasite load are low in this organ. The lack of an association of poor body condition and cachexia with pancreatitis and the low frequency of clinical signs commonly associated with pancreatitis suggest that a significant portion of the organ is not affected by this parasite. On the other hand, the association of poor body condition and cachexia with concomitant infection of the pancreas, spleen, and/or bone marrow with this parasite suggests that these manifestations are the result of a more advanced stage of canine visceral leishmaniasis.

"['Aptamers are small nucleic acids that fold in a three-dimensional conformation allowing them to bind specifically to a target. This target can be an organic molecule, free or carried in cells or tissues, or inorganic components, such as metal ions. Analogous to monoclonal antibodies, aptamers however have certain advantages over the latter: e.g., high specificity for their target, no to low immunogenicity and easy in vitro selection. Since their discovery more than 30\xa0years ago, aptamers have led to various applications, although mainly restricted to basic research. This work reviews the applications of aptamers in veterinary science to date. First, we present aptamers, how they are selected and their properties, then we give examples of applications in food and environmental safety, as well as in diagnosis and medical treatment in the field of veterinary medicine. Because examples of applications in veterinary medicine are scarce, we explore the potential avenues for future applications based on discoveries made in human medicine. Aptamers may offer new possibilities for veterinarians to diagnose certain diseases—particularly infectious diseases—more rapidly or “at the patient’s bedside”.

The prevalence rate was higher in cattle (51.58%) than buffaloes (40.89%) and the difference was statistically significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). Indigenous cattle (59.30%) showed higher seropositivity than crossbreed (57.16%) and exotic cattle breeds (42.28%). Although statistically not significant, female (52.37%) showed higher seropositivity than male (46.43%). Similarly, significant difference in prevalence ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) was observed for animals reared in different climatic zones with highest prevalence recorded in arid zone (90.49%) and lowest in semi-arid zone (29.83%). Very wide variation in prevalence (9.95–100%) was recorded between farms. The present study indicates endemicity of Anaplasma in India, similar to other tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Endemic instability was recorded in some of the studied farms suggesting possibility of outbreak of new clinical cases resulting in economic loss. Therefore, suitable policies and procedures for prevention and control of Anaplasma infection should be adopted in these farms.']","['Sarangi, Laxmi Narayan, [Rana, Samir Kumar], [Prasad, Amitesh], [Ponnanna, Nadikerianda Muthappa], [Sharma, Girish Kumar]']",['10.1007/s12639-020-01312-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-020-01312-7'],[''],['Prevalence of antibodies to Anaplasma in cattle and buffaloes of different organized herds in India']
"['Introduction Anaplasma sp. is an obligatory intracellular Gram-negative tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are the drugs of choice for treating domestic animals with acute anaplasmosis. Lack of documented information about oxytetracycline resistance in Anaplasma species in the world was the scope of this study to screen by PCR for the detection of the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in Anaplasma species from infected cattle and sheep in the Northwest and Southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods Total of 100 cattle and sheep blood samples collected from 2 provinces in the Northwest and 1 province in the Southwest of Iran were tested microscopically by the Giemsa staining examination and confirmed by PCR. Then the presence of two different oxytetracycline-resistance genes ( otrA, and otrB ) was detected by PCR in positive samples. Results The results showed that 60% of Anaplasma -infected samples were identified to have an otrA -resistance gene, and 26.67% had an otrB -resistance gene. The coexistence of two oxytetracycline-resistance determinants was encountered in 13.33% of the isolates. The significant difference in the frequency of otr genes was found among three Anaplasma species ( A. marginale , A. centrale and A. ovis ), and among three studied regions in Iran ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The identified sequences were submitted to the GenBank and deposited under accession numbers MN880729 and MN895439 for otrB and otrA genes. Conclusion This study, for the first time, indicated the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in the three most prevalent Anaplasma species in ruminants. This finding helps to select an appropriate treatment strategy for eradication of anaplasmosis.']","['Shahbazi, Parisa, [Nouri Gharajalar, Sahar], [Mohebbi, Kolsoum], [Taeb, Jafar], [Hashemzadeh Farhang, Hosein], [Nikvand, Ali Abbas], [Norouzi, Roghayeh]']",['10.1007/s11686-020-00306-y'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00306-y'],[''],['First Survey on the Presence and Distribution of Oxytetracycline-Resistance Genes in Anaplasma Species']
"['Cryptosporidiosis is an imperative global health concern. Unfortunately, Nitazoxanide (NTZ) (the nowadays drug of choice) is not effective in treatment of immunocompromised patients.

Mice were divided into five groups; GI: received Mefloquine (400\xa0mg/kg/day), GII: received NTZ (100\xa0mg/kg/bid), GIII: received a combination, half dose regimen of both drugs, GIV: infected untreated and GV: non-infected untreated. Each treated group was divided into three subgroups; Ga prophylaxis (PX), thereafter infection, Gb first and Gc second treatment doses. Assessment was done by parasitological, histopathological and serological techniques. A significant oocyst clearance was detected in all prophylactically treated groups. GIa showed 77% reduction of the mean oocyst count in stool while GIb and GIIIc showed100% oocyst clearance. Histopathologically, the ileocecal sections from GIV showed loss of brush borders with marked villous atrophy. GIa induced a moderate improvement of those pathological changes. Moreover, the villi in GIb and GIIIc retained their normal appearance with minimal inflammatory cells. Serum interferon gamma levels showed highly significant increases in GI&GIII compared to GIV while a non-significant increase was observed in GIIa only. On the contrary, serum interleukin-17 levels showed a highly significant down-regulation in all treated groups in comparison to GIV.

Control of ticks being central to the control of fatal tick-borne diseases, this study attempted to assess the susceptibility/resistance of brown dog ticks to synthetic pyrethroids, the commonly used acaricides against ticks. Larval packet assay revealed 60% of isolates tested to be resistant and tolerant to deltamethrin as per the resistance factor that ranged from 1 to 53.7. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplified product of domain II S4-5 linker of sodium channel gene in R. sanguineus revealed novel polymorphisms, viz., C190A, G215T and T270C. In domain III S6 region of the gene, a T2134C mutation was observed. Genotyping with allele-specific PCR targeting domain II S4-5 linker region using single larvae revealed that most R. sanguineus larvae in the study population were homozygous resistant (RR) genotypes, followed by heterozygous (RS) and homozygous susceptible (SS) genotypes. A higher proportion of RS genotypes was also observed in domain III S6 region.

We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%).

"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks.

"['Background Various tick-borne infections like borreliosis and rickettsiosis pose a health risk to humans in many parts of the world. We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. Methods Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. Results Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. Conclusions Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti- Borrelia -antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years. Rickettsiosis is of limited concern in Denmark.

"['Background African tick bite fever (ATBF) caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by Amblyomma spp. ticks is one of the zoonotic tick-borne fevers from the spotted fever group (SFG) of rickettsiae, which is an emerging global health concern. There is paucity of information regarding the occurrence and awareness of the disease in endemic rural livestock farming communities living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. Methods The purpose of the study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices on ticks and ATBF infection from a community living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. A focus group discussion (FGD) was carried out followed by verbal administration of a standardized semi-structured questionnaire a month later to 38 rural livestock farmers (23 from Caquba area and 15 from Lucingweni area where A. hebraeum was absent). An FGD was conducted in Caquba (situated at the livestock-wildlife interface where Amblyomma hebraeum was prevalent on cattle and infected with Rickettsia africae ) in the O.R. Tambo district of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Results Results from the FGD and questionnaire survey showed that participants from the two rural communities were not aware of ATBF and were not aware that ticks are vectors of the disease. Respondents from Caquba reported of having frequent exposure to tick bites (91.3%, 21/23) specifically from the anthropophilic A. hebrauem which they were able to identify as Qwelagqibe in IsiXhosa (their vernacular). Thirteen out of 15 (86.7%) of respondents from Lucingweni reported that they had never been bitten by ticks, which corresponded with the absence of A. hebraeum from their locality as evidenced from results of a concurrent study on prevalence of ticks on livestock in the area. Both communities confirmed to being “very concerned” of tick bites and we presume this was more related to the localized wounds from the bites than to the diseases transmitted by the ticks.

"['Background The significance of tick-borne diseases has increased considerably in recent years. Because of the unique distribution of the tick species Dermacentor reticulatus in Poland, comprising two expanding populations, Eastern and Western that are separated by a Dermacentor -free zone, it is important to conduct studies on the process of tick expansion and emergence of canine babesiosis. The main aim of the current study was to monitor the expansion of D. reticulatus populations from spring 2016 to autumn 2018 to determine (1) the actual geographical range of this tick species, and (2) and the seasonal/annual shift in range limits and changes in distance between Western and Eastern populations of ticks (the size of the non-endemic area). Methods Ticks were collected in spring/autumn during a 3-year study. From each season and year at least three pairs of sites from the Western and Eastern populations were selected. Then the mean distance between paired sites was calculated for each season and year. We collected and analyzed data from veterinary clinics on the number of canine babesiosis cases treated in the clinic during a whole year (2018). Results Accordingly, further expansion of the two D. reticulatus populations was recorded, mainly along river basins. Marked colonization of the gap zone was observed, with a mean annual shift in the range of 2.5–10 km and a steadily decreasing distance between the two tick populations. The occurrence of babesiosis in different regions revealed low numbers of cases in Western Poland (19 cases/year) and the gap area (only 7 cases/year) and high incidence (up to 250 cases/1000 dogs) and fatality (total 3.65%) in Central and Eastern Poland. Strong associations were found geographically between tick and babesiosis occurrence and temporally in the seasonal patterns of occurrence of ticks and outbreaks of babesiosis. Conclusions We documented the shift in range limits and continued process of colonization of the gap zone accompanied by the emergence of canine babesiosis in the Eastern expansion zone. Updated maps of the distribution of ticks and occurrence of babesiosis in different regions of Poland have allowed us to predict of the emergence of pathogens vectored by D. reticulatus.

Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected. The novel duplex RT-PCR assay provided correct classification of samples positive and negative for B. canis and A. phagocytophilum . The analytical sensitivity of this assay was ten gene copies/ reaction for both pathogens. Conclusions A novel duplex RT-PCR molecular method was developed for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Sequence variability of Bc28.1 and mdh genes indicated the genetic variability of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum isolates occurring in Latvian domestic dogs.

"['Background The emergence of tick-borne disease is increasing because of the effects of the temperature rise driven by global warming. In Turkey, 19 pathogens transmitted by ticks to humans and animals have been reported. Based on this, this study aimed to investigate tick-borne pathogens including Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., and Bartonella spp. in tick samples ( n = 110) collected from different hosts (dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and turtles) by molecular methods. Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected. Hepatozoon spp. was detected in R. sanguineus ticks while Theileria spp. , Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected in R. turanicus and H. marginatum . According to the results of sequence analyses applied for pathogen positive samples, Hepatozoon canis , Theileria ovis , Babesia caballi , and Anaplasma ovis were identified. Conclusion Theileria ovis and Anaplasma ovis were detected for the first time to our knowledge in H. marginatum and R. turanicus collected from Turkey, respectively.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures.

"['Background Plants perform in a specific Eh–pH spectrum and they rely on various processes to ensure their homeostasis, which plays a central role in their defense. The effects of multiple stresses, all translated into oxidative stress into the plant, and the capacity of the latter to respond to these stresses results in specific Eh–pH states in plants. Scope We reviewed plant-invertebrate pests and plant-pathogens interactions under a Eh–pH homeostasis perspective by extensively analyzing the literature, which converges and supports a set of hypotheses. We report examples showing how the development and attacks of pests are correlated to spatio-temporal variations of Eh–pH in plants. We provide evidence-based discussion on how Eh–pH homeostasis can open a new perspective on plant health, and help unravel and disentangle the many Genotype x Environment x Management x Pest and Pathogen interactions. We propose an original perspective on energy allocation and growth-defense tradeoff by plants based on the Eh–pH homeostasis model. Finally, we show how Eh–pH conditions in the rhizosphere are the results of multiple interactions between the root system and microorganisms. Based on this, we hypothesize that soil suppressiveness is derived from soil structure leading to diverse Eh–pH niches that harbor a diversity of microorganisms.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence.

"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%).

The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.

"['Extracellular vesicles are thought to facilitate pathogen transmission from arthropods to humans and other animals. Here, we reveal that pathogen spreading from arthropods to the mammalian host is multifaceted. Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases. Extracellular vesicles have been implicated in the transmission of pathogens from the arthropod to the human host. Here the authors show that tick-derived extracellular vesicles play a role in feeding and modulate the outcome of bacterial infection.']","['Oliva Chávez, Adela S., [Wang, Xiaowei], [Marnin, Liron], [Archer, Nathan K.], [Hammond, Holly L.], [Carroll, Erin E.

"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Several studies have indicated that these changes are likely to accelerate in the future and cause an adverse impact on the environment. The Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, especially Amathole District Municipality (ADM), has recorded a high number of climate change–related disasters including prolonged drought conditions witnessed during the winter season of 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2015 among others. Consequently, this study aimed at exploring remote sensing information to assess and document drought occurrences in the ADM from 2007 to 2017.

For the analysis, a total of 396 satellite imageries (MODIS and TRMM) were used. The results revealed that different correlations exist between the three variables. The significance of correlations differed from one season to another. Furthermore, it was revealed that the drought conditions in the district differed in the spatial distribution. The study accurately identified the drought episodes that occurred in the ADM in the years 2008, 2009, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n \u2009=\u200929), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n \u2009=\u20096), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n \u2009=\u200914) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n \u2009=\u200917) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"
"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities.

"['Background The blood feeding poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae , causes substantial economic damage to the egg laying industry worldwide, and is a serious welfare concern for laying hens and poultry house workers. In this study we have investigated the temporal gene expression across the 6 stages/sexes (egg, larvae, protonymph and deutonymph, adult male and adult female) of this neglected parasite in order to understand the temporal expression associated with development, parasitic lifestyle, reproduction and allergen expression. Results RNA-seq transcript data for the 6 stages were mapped to the PRM genome creating a publicly available gene expression atlas (on the OrcAE platform in conjunction with the PRM genome). Network analysis and clustering of stage-enriched gene expression in PRM resulted in 17 superclusters with stage-specific or multi-stage expression profiles. The 6 stage specific superclusters were clearly demarked from each other and the adult female supercluster contained the most stage specific transcripts (2725), whilst the protonymph supercluster the fewest (165). Fifteen pairwise comparisons performed between the different stages resulted in a total of 6025 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) ( P \u2009>\u20090.99). These data were evaluated alongside a Venn/Euler analysis of the top 100 most abundant genes in each stage. An expanded set of cuticle proteins and enzymes (chitinase and metallocarboxypeptidases) were identified in larvae and underpin cuticle formation and ecdysis to the protonymph stage. Two mucin/peritrophic-A salivary proteins (DEGAL6771g00070, DEGAL6824g00220) were highly expressed in the blood-feeding stages, indicating peritrophic membrane formation during feeding. Reproduction-associated vitellogenins were the most abundant transcripts in adult females whilst, in adult males, an expanded set of serine and cysteine proteinases and an epididymal protein (DEGAL6668g00010) were highly abundant. Assessment of the expression patterns of putative homologues of 32 allergen groups from house dust mites indicated a bias in their expression towards the non-feeding larval stage of PRM. Conclusions This study is the first evaluation of temporal gene expression across all stages of PRM and has provided insight into developmental, feeding, reproduction and survival strategies employed by this mite. The publicly available PRM resource on OrcAE offers a valuable tool for researchers investigating the biology and novel interventions of this parasite.']","['Bartley, Kathryn, [Chen, Wan], [Lloyd Mills, Richard I.], [Nunn, Francesca], [Price, Daniel R.

Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development.

"['Background Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed.']","['Cameron, Laura, [Rocque, Rhéa], [Penner, Kailey], [Mauro, Ian]']",['10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],[''],"['Public perceptions of Lyme disease and climate change in southern Manitoba, Canada: making a case for strategic decoupling of climate and health messages']"
"['Malaria is a principal cause of illness and death in countries where the disease is endemic. Personal protection against mosquitoes using repellents could be a useful method that can reduce and/or prevent transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The available repellent products, such as creams, roll-ons, and sprays for personal protection against mosquitoes, lack adequate long-term efficacy. In most cases, they need to be re-applied or replaced frequently. The encapsulation and release of the repellents from several matrices has risen as an alternative process for the development of invention of repellent based systems. The present work reviews various studies about the development and use of repellent controlled-release formulations such as polymer microcapsules, polymer microporous formulations, polymer micelles, nanoemulsions, solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes and cyclodextrins as new tools for mosquito-borne malaria control in the outdoor environment. Furthermore, investigation on the mathematical modelling used for the release rate of repellents is discussed in depth by exploring the Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Weibull models, as well as the recently developed Mapossa model. Therefore, the studies searched suggest that the final repellents based-product should not only be effective against mosquito vectors of malaria parasites, but also reduce the biting frequency of other mosquitoes transmitting diseases, such as dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus.

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato\xa0(s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2\xa0years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects\xa0models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Results We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2\xa0years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l.\xa0and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Conclusions Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.']","['Bregnard, Cindy, [Rais, Olivier], [Voordouw, Maarten Jeroen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],[''],['Masting by beech trees predicts the risk of Lyme disease']
"['Phenology is a fundamental determinant of species distributions, abundances, and interactions. In host–parasite interactions, host phenology can affect parasite fitness due to the temporal constraints it imposes on host contact rates. However, it remains unclear how parasite transmission is shaped by the wide range of phenological patterns observed in nature. We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi . Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics. These results highlight the importance of phenology, a common driver of species interactions, for the fitness of a parasite.']","['MacDonald, Hannelore, [Akçay, Erol], [Brisson, Dustin]']",['10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],[''],['The role of host phenology for parasite transmission']

We assessed the relative influence of such factors on patterns of infection by Austrodiplostomum compactum (Digenea, Diplostomidae) in fish assemblages of the Upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil. Multiple infection parameters were modeled at the community and species levels using phylogenetic diversity (PD), abundance (total and for a main reservoir species Plagioscion squamosissimus ), local environmental conditions and phylogenetic distance from P. squamosissimus (Dis_Plag). In total, 108 fish species were collected and 28 were infected. At the community level, mean parasite abundance and mean infection intensity were positively associated with PD and the interaction between PD and environmental conditions, whereas host richness was negatively associated with PD. The complementary results indicate a biodiversity sampling effect rather than dilution effect. Environmental conditions often had the strongest coefficients in community-level models and mediated associations between infection parameters and other factors. At the species level, consistent negative associations between infection parameters and Dis_Plag indicate phylogenetic niche conservatism of parasites. Integration of community and species-level analyses demonstrates that phylogenetic diversity can affect host–parasite interactions in multiple ways, but that the associations depend on phylogenetic relationships and environmental conditions.']","['Lima-Junior, Dilermando Pereira, [Bellay, Sybelle], [Hoeinghaus, David J.], [Bini, Luis Mauricio], [Lima, Luciano B.], [Yotoko, Karla], [Agostinho, Angelo Antônio]']",['10.1007/s10750-020-04509-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04509-2'],[''],"['Host diversity, phylogenetic relationships and local environmental factors drive infection patterns of a non-native parasite in tropical floodplain fish assemblages']"

"['Ticks (Arachnida: Acari) are vectors for pathogens and the biggest threat to animal health. Many Australian ticks are associated with pathogens that impact humans, domestic animals and livestock. However, little is known about the presence or impact of tick-borne pathogens in native Australian wildlife. Wombats are particularly susceptible to the effects of the ectoparasite Sarcoptes scabiei which causes sarcoptic mange, the reason for which is unknown. Factors such as other ectoparasites and their associated pathogens may play a role. A critical understanding of the species of ectoparasites that parasitise wombats and their pathogens, and particularly ticks, is therefore warranted. This review describes the ectoparasites of wombats, pathogens known to be associated with those ectoparasites, and related literature gaps. Pathogens have been isolated in most tick species that typically feed on wombats; however, there are minimal molecular studies to determine the presence of pathogens in any other wombat ectoparasites. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allows us to explore entire microbial communities in ectoparasite samples, allowing fast and accurate identification of potential pathogens in many samples at once. These new techniques have highlighted the diversity and uniqueness of native ticks and their microbiomes, including pathogens of potential medical and veterinary importance.

"['Abstract Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards ( Sceloporus occidentalis ) are a key host to western blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus ). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures, or both. We infested adult males with larval ticks for 7 to 10 days, staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits, for either infested or uninfested males. There was also no effect of tick attachment location and hemoparasite infection on host contest behavior. This is the first demonstration of the impact of I. pacificus parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness. Because I. pacificus rely heavily on these lizards for blood meals and dispersal, these impacts could also influence the abundance of ticks and the pathogens they vector. Significance statement Parasitism frequently impairs host behavior. We investigated the effect of blacklegged tick parasitism on western fence lizard contest behavior using a lab-based manipulation experiment. We demonstrated that tick infestation reduced lizard aggressiveness, which may lead to territory loss and reduced mating opportunities in the wild. We found no evidence that host body size or coloration\xa0are correlated with aggression.

"['Background The lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), an important vector of a wide range of human and animal pathogens, is very common throughout the East and Midwest of the USA. Ticks are known to carry non-pathogenic bacteria that may play a role in their vector competence for pathogens. Several previous studies using the high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies reported the commensal bacteria in a tick midgut as abundant and diverse. In contrast, in our preliminary survey of the field collected adult lone star ticks, we found the number of culturable/viable bacteria very low. Methods We aimed to analyze the bacterial community of A. americanum by a parallel culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach applied to individual ticks. Results We analyzed 94 adult females collected in eastern Kansas and found that 60.8% of ticks had no culturable bacteria and the remaining ticks carried only 67.7\u2009±\u200942.8 colony-forming units (CFUs)/tick representing 26 genera.

Remaining OTUs with very low abundance were typical soil bacterial taxa indicating their environmental origin. Conclusions No correlation was found between the CFU abundance and the relative abundance from the culture-independent approach. This suggests that many culturable taxa detected by HTS but not by culture-dependent method were not viable or were not in their culturable state.

Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas.

The response to these challenges requires community participation in the adaptation of animal production systems to new environments and strengthening the efficiency of veterinary services delivery combined with well-coordinated public health services, since many emerging human diseases are zoonotic.']","['Magiri, Royford, [Muzandu, Kaampwe], [Gitau, George], [Choongo, Kennedy], [Iji, Paul]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-45106-6_19'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45106-6_19'],[''],"['Impact of Climate Change on Animal Health, Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases in Africa']"

"['Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) act as important vectors of zoonotic pathogens. For instance, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes pose a severe health risk as aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis. Commonly, to study the abundance of questing (host-seeking) ticks, a 1 m 2 piece of cloth is dragged over vegetation for a determined distance. Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased.']","['Nyrhilä, Siiri, [Sormunen, Jani J.], [Mäkelä, Satu], [Sippola, Ella], [Vesterinen, Eero J.], [Klemola, Tero]']",['10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],[''],['One out of ten: low sampling efficiency of cloth dragging challenges abundance estimates of questing ticks']
"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al.

The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']

In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools.

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses. This study provides the groundwork for assessing stress tolerance in this bipolar ectoparasite.']","['Davies, Benjamin, [Rosendale, Andrew J.], [Gantz, Josiah D.], [Lee, Richard E., Jr.], [Denlinger, David L.], [Benoit, Joshua B.]']",['10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],[''],"['Cross-tolerance and transcriptional shifts underlying abiotic stress in the seabird tick, Ixodes uriae']"
"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

However, there is currently no web-based or mobile application that supports automated classification of tick images. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s). These results demonstrate that, with limited data size for model training, a simple shallow custom-built CNN model has great prospects for use in the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Saeedpour-Parizi, Mohammad R.], [Rahman, Md.

"['Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']
"['Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), as they occur in insects, form a distinct class of proteins that apparently has no closely related representatives in other animals. However, ticks, mites, spiders and millipedes contain genes encoding proteins with sequence similarity to insect OBPs. In this work, we have explored the structure and function of such non-insect OBPs in the mite Varroa destructor , a major pest of honey bee. Varroa OBPs present six cysteines paired into three disulphide bridges, but with positions in the sequence and connections different from those of their insect counterparts. VdesOBP1 structure was determined in two closely related crystal forms and appears to be a monomer. Its structure assembles five α-helices linked by three disulphide bridges, one of them exhibiting a different connection as compared to their insect counterparts. Comparison with classical OBPs reveals that the second of the six α-helices is lacking in VdesOBP1. Ligand-binding experiments revealed molecules able to bind only specific OBPs with a moderate affinity, suggesting that either optimal ligands have still to be identified, or post-translational modifications present in the native proteins may be essential for modulating binding activity, or else these OBPs might represent a failed attempt in evolution and are not used by the mites.']","['Amigues, Beatrice, [Zhu, Jiao], [Gaubert, Anais], [Arena, Simona], [Renzone, Giovanni], [Leone, Philippe], [Fischer, Isabella Maria], [Paulsen, Harald], [Knoll, Wolfgang], [Scaloni, Andrea], [Roussel, Alain], [Cambillau, Christian], [Pelosi, Paolo]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],[''],['A new non-classical fold of varroa odorant-binding proteins reveals a wide open internal cavity']

Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence.

Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001).

"['Background An epitope, Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R, termed α-gal, is present in glycoconjugates of New World monkeys (platyrrhines) and other mammals but not in hominoids and Old World monkeys (catarrhines). The difference is due to the inactivation of α1-3 galactosyl transferase (α1-3 GT) genes in catarrhines. Natural antibodies to α-gal are therefore developed in catarrhines but not platyrrhines and other mammals. Hypersensitivity reactions are commonly elicited by mosquito and tick vector bites. IgE antibodies against α-gal cause food allergy to red meat in persons who have been exposed to tick bites. Three enzymes synthesising the terminal α1-3-linked galactose in α-gal, that are homologous to mammalian α and β1-4 GTs but not mammalian α1-3 GTs, were recently identified in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis . IgG and IgM antibodies to α-gal are reported to protect against malaria because mosquito-derived sporozoites of malaria parasites express α-gal on their surface. This article explores the possibility that the α-gal in sporozoites are acquired from glycoconjugates synthesised by mosquitoes rather than through de novo synthesis by sporozoites. Methods The presence of proteins homologous to the three identified tick α1-3 GTs and mammalian α1-3 GTs in two important mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae , as well as Plasmodium malaria parasites, was investigated by BLASTp analysis to help clarify the source of the α-gal on sporozoite surfaces. Results Anopheles gambiae and Ae. aegypti possessed several different proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with α1-3 GT activity, but not mammalian α1-3 GTs. The putative mosquito α1-3 GTs possessed conserved protein domains characteristic of glycosyl transferases. However, the genus Plasmodium lacked proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with α1-3 GT activity and mammalian α1-3 GTs. Conclusions The putative α1-3 GTs identified in the two mosquito vectors may synthesise glycoconjugates containing α-gal that can be transferred to sporozoite surfaces before they are inoculated into skin during blood feeding. The findings merit further investigation because of their implications for immunity against malaria, hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, primate evolution, and proposals for immunisation against α-gal.

Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Yet, the structural and functional requirements to promote the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Utilising in silico and in vitro methods, we here map the conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD) and provide first insights into its structure and function. By focusing on iRhom2, we identified different structural and functional factors within the IRHD. We found that the structural integrity of the IRHD is a key factor for ADAM17 binding. In addition, we identified a highly conserved motif within an unstructured region of the IRHD, that, when mutated, restricts the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex through the secretory pathway in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo systems and also increases the half-life of iRhom2 and ADAM17. Furthermore, the disruption of this IRHD motif was also reflected by changes in the yet undescribed interaction profile of iRhom2 with proteins involved in intracellular vesicle transport. Overall, we provide the first insights into the forward trafficking of iRhoms which is critical for TNFα and EGF receptor signalling.']","['Düsterhöft, Stefan, [Kahveci-Türköz, Selcan], [Wozniak, Justyna], [Seifert, Anke], [Kasparek, Petr], [Ohm, Henrike], [Liu, Shixin], [Kopkanova, Jana], [Lokau, Juliane], [Garbers, Christoph], [Preisinger, Christian], [Sedlacek, Radislav], [Freeman, Matthew], [Ludwig, Andreas]']",['10.1007/s00018-021-03845-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-021-03845-3'],[''],['The iRhom homology domain is indispensable for ADAM17-mediated TNFα and EGF receptor ligand release']
"['Plants are very susceptible to pathogens and every year, 25% of crop loss is caused by various types of pathogens including viruses. Many different strategies are being used for developing resistance against virus infection, including RNA silencing, and the genome editing including CRISPR-Cas-9 but these may produce variants/recombinants and could cause the problems for future crops. Another promising approach named as genome recoding or rewriting would be a better potential tool for controlling viral infections in plants. It relies on the concepts of replacement of synonymous codons, change in codon bias, codon pair bias and dinucleotide content. Recoding of the genome does not alter the amino acid sequences but it affects the expression level and translation efficiency. In the present report, the concept of synonymous codons, the basics of genome recoding and the possible strategies to generate genome recoded organisms are provided in details. Viral attenuation has been achieved by consideration of dinucleotide bias and codon pair bias manipulations and used in the synthesis of vaccines against various types of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The idea of the future scope of genome recoding for developing virus-resistant plants and their challenges for the same are also comprehensively discussed. Although genome recoding is not yet tested on plants, however it could be very helpful in controlling plant viral diseases.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Punica granatum red peel and Acacia saligna leaf extracts on Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus GST activity in order to reduce the resistance of cattle to acaricide. The results showed that P. granatum ethanol extract (70%) contained the highest total phenol content (350\u2009±\u20091.2\xa0μM GAE g −1 ), the highest condensed tannin content (270\u2009±\u20091.3\xa0μM CE g −1 ) and the highest hydrolysable tannin content (70\u2009±\u20095.0\xa0μM TAE g −1 ).

"['Background Relapsing fever (RF) borreliae are arthropod-borne spirochetes and some of them cause human diseases, which are characterized by relapsing or recurring episodes of fever. Recently, it has been classified into two groups: soft tick-borne RF (STRF) borreliae and hard tick-borne RF (HTRF) borreliae. STRF borreliae include classical RF agents and HTRF borreliae, the latter of which include B. miyamotoi , a human pathogen recently identified in Eurasia and North America. Results In this study, we determined the genome sequences of 16 HTRF borreliae strains: 15 B. miyamotoi strains (9 from Hokkaido Island, Japan, 3 from Honshu Island, Japan, and 3 from Mongolia) and a Borrelia sp. tHM16w. Chromosomal gene synteny was highly conserved among the HTRF strains sequenced in this study, even though they were isolated from different geographic regions and different tick species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sequences revealed that HTRF and STRF borreliae are clearly distinguishable, with each forming a monophyletic group in the RF borreliae lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary relationships of RF borreliae are consistent with the biological and ecological features of each RF borreliae sublineage and can explain the unique characteristics of Borrelia anserina . In addition, the pairwise genetic distances between HTRF borreliae strains were well correlated with those of vector species rather than with the geographical distances between strain isolation sites. This result suggests that the genetic diversification of HTRF borreliae is attributed to the speciation of vector ticks and that this relationship might be required for efficient transmission of HTRF borreliae within vector ticks. Conclusions The results of the present study, together with those from previous investigations, support the hypothesis that the common ancestor of borreliae was transmitted by hard-bodied ticks and that only STRF borreliae switched to using soft-bodied ticks as a vector, which was followed by the emergence of Borrelia recurrentis , lice-borne RF borreliae. Our study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships between RF borreliae, and the data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of RF borreliae.']","['Nakao, Ranna, [Kasama, Kentaro], [Boldbaatar, Bazartseren], [Ogura, Yoshitoshi], [Kawabata, Hiroki], [Toyoda, Atsushi], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Maeda, Ken]']",['10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],[''],['The evolution of hard tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae is correlated with vector species rather than geographical distance']

"['Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii , which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus . Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii -infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii -infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']
"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n \u2009=\u200929), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n \u2009=\u20096), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n \u2009=\u200914) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n \u2009=\u200917) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

Although online reviews represent a rich source of user information, they have rarely been used in determining the risk of tick exposure during recreational trail use. Based on online user reviews and comments, the purpose of this study was to determine risk factors and behavioral recommendations associated with tick encounters ( Tick Presence ) on recreational trails in the state of Indiana, U.S. Methods We reviewed 26,016 user comments left on AllTrails.com for 697 Indiana trails. Reviews were evaluated to determine Tick Presence/Absence , the total number of Tick Presence Reviews per trail, and multiple trail and user behavioral characteristics. We used hot spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis to test the hypothesis of whether there are clusters in the number of Tick Presence Reviews . Pearson chi-square tests of independence evaluated whether tick presence was associated with several trail characteristics. Finally, negative binomial regression evaluated the strength of the association between the number of Tick Presence Reviews and several trail characteristics. Results Tick Presence was recorded at 10% ( n \u2009=\u200965) of trails and occurred most frequently in May.

"['Elasticity analysis is a key tool in the analysis of matrix population models, which describe the dynamics of stage-structured populations in ecology and evolution. Elasticities of the dominant eigenvalue of a matrix model to matrix entries obey certain symmetries. Yet not all consequences of these symmetries are fully appreciated, as they are sometimes hidden in mathematical detail. Here, we propose a method to reason about these symmetries directly by visual inspection of the life cycle graph that corresponds to the matrix model. We present two applications of this method, one in ecology and one in evolution. First, we prove several conjectures about elasticities that were obtained from purely numerical results and that can support population managers in decision-making under scarce demographic information. Second, we show how to identify candidates for invariant trade-offs in evolutionary optimal life cycles. The method extends to the elasticity analysis of non-dominant eigenvalues, of the stochastic growth rate and, in next-generation matrices, of the basic reproduction number.']","['Giaimo, Stefano, [Traulsen, Arne]']",['10.1007/s12080-021-00513-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-021-00513-x'],[''],['Applying symmetries of elasticities in matrix population models']
"['Despite its clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Background Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current indoor vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis . Methods The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus , and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control . Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function. Results All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68–73%.

"['Fusarium graminearum is a major fungal pathogen affecting crops of worldwide importance. F. graminearum produces type B trichothecene mycotoxins (TCTB), which are not fully eliminated during food and feed processing. Therefore, the best way to minimize TCTB contamination is to develop prevention strategies. Herein we show that treatment with the reduced form of the γ-core of the tick defensin DefMT3, referred to as TickCore3 (TC3), decreases F. graminearum growth and abrogates TCTB production. The oxidized form of TC3 loses antifungal activity, but retains anti-mycotoxin activity. Molecular dynamics show that TC3 is recruited by specific membrane phospholipids in F. graminearum and that membrane binding of the oxidized form of TC3 is unstable. Capping each of the three cysteine residues of TC3 with methyl groups reduces its inhibitory efficacy. Substitutions of the positively-charged residues lysine (Lys) 6 or arginine 7 by threonine had the highest and the lesser impact, respectively, on the anti-mycotoxin activity of TC3. We conclude that the binding of linear TC3 to F. graminearum membrane phospholipids is required for the antifungal activity of the reduced peptide.

In this study we have investigated the temporal gene expression across the 6 stages/sexes (egg, larvae, protonymph and deutonymph, adult male and adult female) of this neglected parasite in order to understand the temporal expression associated with development, parasitic lifestyle, reproduction and allergen expression. Results RNA-seq transcript data for the 6 stages were mapped to the PRM genome creating a publicly available gene expression atlas (on the OrcAE platform in conjunction with the PRM genome). Network analysis and clustering of stage-enriched gene expression in PRM resulted in 17 superclusters with stage-specific or multi-stage expression profiles. The 6 stage specific superclusters were clearly demarked from each other and the adult female supercluster contained the most stage specific transcripts (2725), whilst the protonymph supercluster the fewest (165). Fifteen pairwise comparisons performed between the different stages resulted in a total of 6025 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) ( P \u2009>\u20090.99). These data were evaluated alongside a Venn/Euler analysis of the top 100 most abundant genes in each stage. An expanded set of cuticle proteins and enzymes (chitinase and metallocarboxypeptidases) were identified in larvae and underpin cuticle formation and ecdysis to the protonymph stage. Two mucin/peritrophic-A salivary proteins (DEGAL6771g00070, DEGAL6824g00220) were highly expressed in the blood-feeding stages, indicating peritrophic membrane formation during feeding. Reproduction-associated vitellogenins were the most abundant transcripts in adult females whilst, in adult males, an expanded set of serine and cysteine proteinases and an epididymal protein (DEGAL6668g00010) were highly abundant. Assessment of the expression patterns of putative homologues of 32 allergen groups from house dust mites indicated a bias in their expression towards the non-feeding larval stage of PRM. Conclusions This study is the first evaluation of temporal gene expression across all stages of PRM and has provided insight into developmental, feeding, reproduction and survival strategies employed by this mite.

In addition, we investigated the pathogens that the ticks carry ( Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Rickettsia sp. and Babesia sp.) by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We collected a total of 875 ticks from the ground and from various animals and kept them at 4\xa0°C until experiments.

"['Objective To analyze the levels of high mobility group box\xa01 (HMGB1) protein on different courses of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods In our prospective longitudinal study, children with JIA were included with their blood samples collected at the first visit, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, respectively. Samples were also collected from healthy controls and children with reactive arthritis at the first visit. Levels of HMGB1 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Clinical disease characteristics and routine laboratory findings were analyzed as well. Results A total of 64 children were enrolled, of whom 31 (48.4%) were female. The median age at the first visit for participants with JIA was 9.25\u2009years (range, 1.42–15.42) and the median duration of disease was 2.38\u2009months (range, 1.53–49.31). Serum HMGB1 levels at the first visit were significantly elevated in children with systemic JIA compared with other groups, and so were in enthesitis-related arthritis versus healthy controls. Significant correlations were established at the first visit between HMGB1 levels and duration of disease, C-reactive protein, percentage of neutrophils, and ferritin. Data from all samples revealed that serum HMGB1 levels in JIA were significantly associated with erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, percentage of neutrophils, and disease activity scores. Conclusions Serum HMGB1 may be associated with clinical disease activity of JIA and specifically increased at the first visit in children with systemic JIA, suggesting its function as a sensitive inflammatory marker.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum . This study provides crucial information for ungulate management as a tool to mitigate zoonotic disease risk and argues for adapting management approaches to the local ungulate species composition and the pathogen(s) of concern.

"['Introduction COVID-19 long-haulers, also decribed as having “long-COVID” or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, represent 10% of COVID-19 patients and remain understudied. Methods In this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms (>\u200930\xa0days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation, including clinical, psychologic, virologic and specific immunologic assays and were followed longitudinally. A group of 17 convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms were included as a comparison group. Results The median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35–54] years and 18 (60%) were female. At a median time of 152 [102–164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were less frequently reported compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was unremarkable in all patients, although the median fatigue and pain visual analog scales were 7 [5–8] and 5 [2–6], respectively. Extensive biologic studies were unremarkable, and multiplex cytokines and ultra-sensitive interferon-α2 measurements were similar between long-haulers and convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-γ ELISPOT, we found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with evidence of a lack of immune response, or a waning immune response, in two patients. Finally, psychiatric evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Conclusions Half of patients seeking medical help for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome lack SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, or not, had no consequence on the clinical or biologic characteristics of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome patients, all of whom reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life and psychologic distress.']","['Scherlinger, Marc, [Felten, Renaud], [Gallais, Floriane], [Nazon, Charlotte], [Chatelus, Emmanuel], [Pijnenburg, Luc], [Mengin, Amaury], [Gras, Adrien], [Vidailhet, Pierre], [Arnould-Michel, Rachel], [Bibi-Triki, Sabrina], [Carapito, Raphaël], [Trouillet-Assant, Sophie], [Perret, Magali], [Belot, Alexandre], [Bahram, Seiamak], [Arnaud, Laurent], [Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric], [Fafi-Kremer, Samira], [Sibilia, Jean]']",['10.1007/s40121-021-00484-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40121-021-00484-w'],[''],['Refining “Long-COVID” by a Prospective Multimodal Evaluation of Patients with Long-Term Symptoms Attributed to SARS-CoV-2 Infection']

However, drugs that combat microbial infections can become a human health threat due to their high and often indiscriminate consumption, considered one of the factors of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emergence. The AMR crisis, the decrease in new drug development by the pharmaceutical industry, and reduced economic incentives for research have all reduced the options for treating infections, and new strategies are necessary, including the return of some traditional but “forgotten” antibiotics. However, prescriptions for these older drugs including nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin, have been based on the results of pioneer studies, and the limited knowledge generated 50–70 years ago may not be enough. To avoid harming patients and further increasing multidrug resistance, systematic evaluation is required, mainly for the drugs prescribed for community-acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTI). Therefore, this review has the objective of reporting the use of two classic drugs from the nitrofuran and phosphonic acid classes for UTI control nowadays.

"['Objective To approach the clinical value of MRI with vessel wall imaging (VWI) in patients with central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV), we analyzed patterns of VWI findings both at the time of initial presentation and during follow-up. Methods Stenoocclusive lesions, vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) and diffusion-restricted lesions were analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of CNSV. On available VWI follow-up, progression, regression or stability of VW-CE were evaluated and correlated with the clinical status. Results Of the 45 patients included, 28 exhibited stenoses visible on MR angiography (MRA-positive) while 17 had no stenosis (MRA-negative). VW-CE was found in 2/17 MRA-negative and all MRA-positive patients ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). 79.1% (53/67) of stenoses showed VW-CE. VW-CE was concentric in 88.3% and eccentric in 11.7% of cases. Diffusion-restricted lesions were found more frequently in relation to stenoses with VW-CE than without VW-CE ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). 48 VW-CE lesions in 23 patients were followed over a median time of 239.5\xa0days. 13 VW-CE lesions (27.1%) resolved completely, 14 (29.2%) showed partial regression, 17 (35.4%) remained stable and 4 (8.3%) progressed. 22/23 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for the duration of follow-up. Patients with stable or progressive VW-CE were more likely ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) to have a relapse (14/30 cases) than patients with partial or complete regression of VW-CE (5/25 cases). Conclusion Concentric VW-CE is a common finding in medium/large-sized vessel CNSV. VW-CE might represent active inflammation in certain situations.

This study recorded cortical auditory evoked potentials from younger to middle-aged (<\u200965\xa0years) and older (≥\u200965\xa0years) cochlear-implant (CI) listeners to assess age-related changes in temporal processing, where cochlear processing is bypassed in this population. Aging effects were compared to age-matched normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Advancing age was associated with prolonged P2 latencies in both CI and NH listeners in response to a 1000-Hz tone or a syllable /da/, and with prolonged N1 latencies in CI listeners in response to the syllable. Advancing age was associated with larger N1 amplitudes in NH listeners. These age-related changes in latency and amplitude were independent of stimulus presentation rate. Further, CI listeners exhibited prolonged N1 and P2 latencies and smaller P2 amplitudes than NH listeners. Thus, aging appears to degrade some aspects of auditory temporal processing when peripheral-cochlear contributions are largely removed, suggesting that changes beyond the cochlea may contribute to age-related temporal processing deficits.']","['Xie, Zilong, [Stakhovskaya, Olga], [Goupell, Matthew J.], [Anderson, Samira]']",['10.1007/s10162-021-00804-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10162-021-00804-4'],[''],['Aging Effects on Cortical Responses to Tones and Speech in Adult Cochlear-Implant Users']
"['Infectious agents can trigger autoimmune responses in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. Lyme arthritis, which is caused by the tick-transmitted spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi , is effectively treated in most patients with antibiotic therapy; however, in a subset of patients, arthritis can persist and worsen after the spirochaete has been killed (known as post-infectious Lyme arthritis). This Review details the current understanding of the pathogenetic events in Lyme arthritis, from initial infection in the skin, through infection of the joints, to post-infectious chronic inflammatory arthritis. The central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is an excessive, dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response during the infection phase that persists into the post-infectious period. This response is characterized by high amounts of IFNγ and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The consequences of this dysregulated pro-inflammatory response in the synovium include impaired tissue repair, vascular damage, autoimmune and cytotoxic processes, and fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. These synovial characteristics are similar to those in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, post-infectious Lyme arthritis provides a model for other chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory arthritides in which complex immune responses can be triggered and shaped by an infectious agent in concert with host genetic factors. Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of Lyme disease, can sometimes persist in a chronic post-infectious disease. In this Review, the authors argue that post-infectious Lyme arthritis could act as a model to improve understanding of other forms of chronic arthritis. A combination of spirochaetal and host genetic factors shape the outcome of Lyme arthritis, which ranges from mild, antibiotic-responsive joint inflammation to persistent, antibiotic-refractory autoinflammatory or autoimmune synovitis. Certain highly inflammatory strains of Borrelia burgdorferi most commonly found in north-eastern USA are present at an increased frequency among patients who subsequently develop post-infectious Lyme arthritis. The histology of post-infectious Lyme arthritis synovia is similar to that in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis, but there is greater microvascular damage in Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi is no longer present in synovia after treatment with antibiotics, but B. burgdorferi peptidoglycan might persist and could be an important promoter of innate immune responses. Dysregulated, excessive IFNγ responses and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are a central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis, and contribute to persistent inflammation and the development of autoimmunity. Synovial fibroblasts, the most common cell in the synovial lesion, become immune effector cells capable of altering the innate and adaptive immune microenvironment in Lyme arthritis.']","['Lochhead, Robert B., [Strle, Klemen], [Arvikar, Sheila L.], [Weis, Janis J.], [Steere, Allen C.]']",['10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],[''],"['Lyme arthritis: linking infection, inflammation and autoimmunity']"
"['Infectious agents, including viruses and bacteria, are proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to this hypothesis, these agents have capacity to evade the host immune system leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and subsequent deposition of Aβ and phosphorylated-tau in the brain. Co-existing proteinopathies and age-related pathologies are common in AD and the brains of elderly individuals, but whether these are also related to neuroinfections remain to be established. This study determined the prevalence and distribution of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in patients with infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis ( n \u2009=\u200913) and neurosyphilis ( n \u2009=\u200923).

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. These new findings pave the way for the development of new strategies for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.

"['Background Malaria is a major health problem in Ethiopia. Sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is its major control strategy. Despite high LLINs use (84%) in Ziway-Dugda District, malaria remained a public health problem, raising concern on its effectiveness. Understanding the effectiveness of malaria control interventions is vital. This study evaluated the effectiveness of LLINs and determinants of malaria in Ziway-Dugda District, Arsi Zone Ethiopia. Methods A matched case–control study was conducted among 284 study participants (71 cases and 213 controls) in Ziway-Dugda District, Arsi Zone, Ethiopia from March to May, 2017. Three health centers were selected randomly, and enrolled individuals newly diagnosed for malaria proportionally. Cases and controls were individuals testing positive and negative for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests. Each case was matched to three controls using the age of (5\xa0years), gender and village of residence. The information was collected using pre-tested structured questionnaires through face to face interviews and observation. Data were entered into Epi-Info version 3.5, and analysed using Stata version-12 . Conditional logistic regression was performed, and odds of LLINs use were compared using matched Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of\u2009<\u20090.05. Results One hundred twenty-three (61.2%) of the controls and 22 (32.8%) of cases had regularly slept under LLINs in the past two weeks. Using multivariate analysis, sleeping under LLINs for the past two weeks (AOR\u2009=\u20090.23, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.11–0.45); living in houses sprayed with indoor residual spray (IRS) (AOR\u2009=\u20090.23, 95%CI: 0.10–0.52); and staying late outdoors at night in the past two-weeks (AOR\u2009=\u20092.99, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.44–6.19) were determinant factors. Conclusions Sleeping under LLINs is effective for malaria prevention in the district. IRS and staying late outdoors at night were determinants of malaria. It is recommended to increase attention on strengthening LLINs use and IRS in the area.']","['Wubishet, Mesfin Kelkile, [Berhe, Gebretsadik], [Adissu, Alefech], [Tafa, Mesfin Segni]']",['10.1186/s12936-021-03833-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03833-9'],[''],"['Effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets in prevention of malaria among individuals visiting health centres in Ziway-Dugda District, Ethiopia: matched case–control study']"

Initially, the MRI input images are fed to preprocessing steps. Then, the image segmentation is carried out by fuzzy-c means (FCM) clustering for identifying the tumor region. These tumor and non-tumor images undergo a feature extraction process utilizing principle component analysis (PCA), mean, entropy, and wavelet transform. The obtained feature vector is fed to the RBNN layer. It needs an optimal CC, which can be considered by using the newly proposed IWOA. RBNN classifies the abnormality of the brain into brain tumor, inflammatory disease, stroke, and degenerative. Its performance is tested on three datasets.

"['Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m 2 ) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m 2 ) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.']","['Hansford, Kayleigh M., [McGinley, Liz], [Wilkinson, Samantha], [Gillingham, Emma L.], [Cull, Ben], [Gandy, Sara], [Carter, Daniel P.], [Vaux, Alexander G.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s). These results demonstrate that, with limited data size for model training, a simple shallow custom-built CNN model has great prospects for use in the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Saeedpour-Parizi, Mohammad R.], [Rahman, Md.

"['Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

"['Pediatric use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the Netherlands is highly prevalent. The risks of pediatric CAM use are, however, largely unknown. Therefore, a 3-year survey was carried out at the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Pediatricians were asked to register cases of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage. In 3 years, 32 unique adverse events were registered. Twenty-two of these adverse events were indirect and not related to the specific CAM therapy but due to delaying, changing, or stopping of regular treatment, a deficient or very restrictive diet or an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist. These events were associated with many different CAM therapies. Nine events were deemed direct adverse events like bodily harm or toxicity and one-third of them occurred in infants. Only supplements, manual therapies, and (Chinese) herbs were involved in these nine events. In one case, there was a risk of a serious adverse event but harm had not yet occurred. Conclusion : Relatively few cases of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage were found, mostly due to delaying or stopping conventional treatment. Nevertheless, parents, pediatricians and CAM providers should be vigilant for both direct and indirect adverse events in children using CAM, especially in infants. What’s Known: • The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in children is common. • Previous surveillance studies in other countries showed severe adverse events may occur after pediatric CAM usage. What is New: • In the Netherlands CAM-related adverse events are rare but can occur, with variable etiology and severity (from mild to potentially life-threatening) • Most CAM-related adverse events are not directly the result of CAM toxicities but rather are associated with withdrawal from appropriate therapies or with providers unable to recognize health-relevant states and delaying important diagnoses.']","['Vos, Björn, [Rake, Jan Peter], [Vlieger, Arine]']",['10.1007/s00431-020-03899-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03899-8'],[''],['Adverse events associated with pediatric complementary and alternative medicine in the Netherlands: a national surveillance study']
"['Purpose of Review This article presents a comprehensive narrative review of reactive arthritis (ReA) with focus on articles published between 2018 and 2020. We discuss the entire spectrum of microbial agents known to be the main causative agents of ReA, those reported to be rare infective agents, and those reported to be new candidates causing the disease. The discussion is set within the context of changing disease terminology, definition, and classification over time. Further, we include reports that present at least a hint of effective antimicrobial therapy for ReA as documented in case reports or in double-blind controlled studies. Additional information is included on microbial products detected in the joint, as well as on the positivity of HLA-B27. Recent Findings Recent reports of ReA cover several rare causative microorganism such as Neisseria meningitides , Clostridium difficile , Escherichia coli , Hafnia alvei , Blastocytosis , Giardia lamblia , Cryptosporidium , Cyclospora cayetanensis , Entamoeba histolytica/dispar , Strongyloides stercoralis , β-haemolytic Streptococci , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin, and Rickettsia rickettsii. The most prominent new infectious agents implicated as causative in ReA are Staphylococcus lugdunensis , placenta- and umbilical cord–derived Wharton’s jelly, Rothia mucilaginosa , and most importantly the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Summary In view of the increasingly large spectrum of causative agents, diagnostic consideration for the disease must include the entire panel of post-infectious arthritides termed ReA. Diagnostic procedures cannot be restricted to the well-known HLA-B27-associated group of ReA, but must also cover the large number of rare forms of arthritis following infections and vaccinations, as well as those elicited by the newly identified members of the ReA group summarized herein. Inclusion of these newly identified etiologic agents must necessitate increased research into the pathogenic mechanisms variously involved, which will engender important insights for treatment and management of ReA.']","['Zeidler, Henning, [Hudson, Alan P.]']",['10.1007/s11926-021-01018-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11926-021-01018-6'],[''],['Reactive Arthritis Update: Spotlight on New and Rare Infectious Agents Implicated as Pathogens']
"['COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

"['Pathogens continue to emerge from increased contact with novel host species. Whilst these hosts can represent distinct environments for pathogens, the impacts of host genetic background on how a pathogen evolves post-emergence are unclear. In a novel interaction, we experimentally evolved a pathogen ( Staphylococcus aureus ) in populations of wild nematodes ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) to test whether host genotype and genetic diversity affect pathogen evolution. After ten rounds of selection, we found that pathogen virulence evolved to vary across host genotypes, with differences in host metal ion acquisition detected as a possible driver of increased host exploitation. Diverse host populations selected for the highest levels of pathogen virulence, but infectivity was constrained, unlike in host monocultures. We hypothesise that population heterogeneity might pool together individuals that contribute disproportionately to the spread of infection or to enhanced virulence. The genomes of evolved populations were sequenced, and it was revealed that pathogens selected in distantly-related host genotypes diverged more than those in closely-related host genotypes. S. aureus nevertheless maintained a broad host range.

Patients and methods The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings. Results Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients). Conclusion White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population.

To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses. This study provides the groundwork for assessing stress tolerance in this bipolar ectoparasite.']","['Davies, Benjamin, [Rosendale, Andrew J.], [Gantz, Josiah D.], [Lee, Richard E., Jr.], [Denlinger, David L.], [Benoit, Joshua B.]']",['10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],[''],"['Cross-tolerance and transcriptional shifts underlying abiotic stress in the seabird tick, Ixodes uriae']"
"['Background H3K27M-mutant midline lesions were recently reclassified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “diffuse midline glioma” (DMG) based entirely on their molecular signature. DMG is one of the most common and most lethal pediatric brain tumors; terminal progression is typically caused by local midbrain or brainstem progression, or secondary leptomeningeal dissemination. H3K27M mutations have also been infrequently associated with a histologically and prognostically diverse set of lesions, particularly spinal masses with early leptomeningeal spread. Case presentation A 15-year-old girl after 1\xa0week of symptoms was found to have a T2/FLAIR-hyperintense and contrast-enhancing thalamic mass accompanied by leptomeningeal enhancement along the entire neuraxis. Initial infectious workup was negative, and intracranial biopsy was inconclusive. Spinal arachnoid biopsy revealed an H3K27M-mutant lesion with glioneuronal features, classified thereafter as DMG. She received craniospinal irradiation with a boost to the thalamic lesion. Imaging 1-month post-radiation demonstrated significant treatment response with residual enhancement at the conus. Conclusions This case report describes the unique presentation of an H3K27M-mutant midline lesion with significant craniospinal leptomeningeal spread on admission and atypical glioneuronal histopathological markers. With such florid leptomeningeal disease, spinal dural biopsy should be considered earlier given its diagnostic yield in classifying the lesion as DMG. Consistent with similar prior reports, this lesion additionally demonstrated synaptophysin positivity—also potentially consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT). In atypical DMG cases, particularly with leptomeningeal spread, further consideration of clinical and histopathological context is necessary for accurate diagnosis and prognostication.']","['Navarro, Ralph E., [Golub, Danielle], [Hill, Travis], [McQuinn, Michelle W.], [William, Christopher], [Zagzag, David], [Hidalgo, Eveline Teresa]']",['10.1007/s00381-020-04892-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00381-020-04892-0'],[''],['Pediatric midline H3K27M-mutant tumor with disseminated leptomeningeal disease and glioneuronal features: case report and literature review']
"['The goal of sentence matching is to determine the semantic relation between two sentences, which is the basis of many downstream tasks in natural language processing, such as question answering and information retrieval. Recent studies using attention mechanism to align the elements of two sentences have shown promising results in capturing semantic similarity/relevance. Most existing methods mainly focus on the design of multi-layer attention network, however, some critical issues have not been dealt with well: 1) the higher attention layer is easily affected by error propagation because it relies on the alignment results of preceding attentions; 2) models have the risk of losing low-layer semantic features with the increase of network depth; and 3) the approach of capturing global matching information brings about large computing complexity for model training. To this end, we propose a Deep Bi-Directional Interaction Network (DBDIN) to solve these issues, which captures semantic relatedness from two directions and each direction employs multiple attention-based interaction units. To be specific, the attention of each interaction unit will repeatedly focus on the original sentence representation of another one for semantic alignment, which alleviates the error propagation problem by attending to a fixed semantic representation. Then we design deep fusion to aggregate and propagate attention information from low layers to high layers, which effectively retains low-layer semantic features for subsequential interactions. Moreover, we introduce a self-attention mechanism at last to enhance global matching information with smaller model complexity. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and paraphrase identification tasks with three benchmark datasets SNLI, SciTail and Quora. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve significant improvements over baseline systems without using any external knowledge. Additionally, we conduct interpretable study to disclose how our deep interaction network with attention can benefit sentence matching, which provides a reference for future model design. Ablation studies and visualization analyses further verify that our model can better capture interactive information between two sentences, and the proposed components are indeed able to help modeling semantic relation more precisely.']","['Liu, Mingtong, [Zhang, Yujie], [Xu, Jinan], [Chen, Yufeng]']",['10.1007/s10489-020-02156-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02156-7'],[''],['Deep bi-directional interaction network for sentence matching']

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks.

There is a growing need to understand national trends in exposures and health outcomes associated with climate change and the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies for health. To date, most indicators for health implications of climate change have been designed as independent, individual metrics. This approach fails to take into account how exposure-outcome pathways for climate-attributable health outcomes involve multiple, interconnected components.

"['The composition of wildlife communities can have strong effects on transmission of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens, with more diverse communities often supporting lower infection prevalence in vectors (dilution effect). The introduced Burmese python, Python bivittatus , is eliminating large and medium-sized mammals throughout southern Florida, USA, impacting local communities and the ecology of zoonotic pathogens. We investigated invasive predator-mediated impacts on ecology of Everglades virus (EVEV), a zoonotic pathogen endemic to Florida that circulates in mosquito-rodent cycle. Using binomial generalized linear mixed effects models of field data at areas of high and low python densities, we show that increasing diversity of dilution host (non-rodent mammals) is associated with decreasing blood meals on amplifying hosts (cotton rats), and that increasing cotton rat host use is associated with increasing EVEV infection in vector mosquitoes. The Burmese python has caused a dramatic decrease in mammal diversity in southern Florida, which has shifted vector host use towards EVEV amplifying hosts (rodents), resulting in an indirect increase in EVEV infection prevalence in vector mosquitoes, putatively elevating human transmission risk. Our results indicate that an invasive predator can impact wildlife communities in ways that indirectly affect human health, highlighting the need for conserving biological diversity and natural communities. Burkett-Cadena et al. use a combination of field survey methods, citizen science data, and molecular analysis to determine how the invasive Burmese python distribution affects mammal host use and virus infection by vector mosquitoes.

"['Over the past several decades the dramatic increase in the availability of computational resources, coupled with the maturation of machine learning, has profoundly impacted sensor technology. In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to ‘lock-in’ to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from ‘big data’ analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others. Traditional sensing techniques apply computational analysis at the output of the sensor hardware to separate signal from noise.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']
"['Purpose of Review Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health challenge. This review aims to summarize the incidence, risk factors, possible pathophysiology, and proposed management of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-PASC based on the published literature. Recent Findings The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. Summary With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments. Awareness among the general population and health care professionals about PASC is rising, and more efforts are needed to understand and treat this new emerging challenge.

"['Infectious agents can trigger autoimmune responses in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. Lyme arthritis, which is caused by the tick-transmitted spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi , is effectively treated in most patients with antibiotic therapy; however, in a subset of patients, arthritis can persist and worsen after the spirochaete has been killed (known as post-infectious Lyme arthritis). This Review details the current understanding of the pathogenetic events in Lyme arthritis, from initial infection in the skin, through infection of the joints, to post-infectious chronic inflammatory arthritis. The central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is an excessive, dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response during the infection phase that persists into the post-infectious period. This response is characterized by high amounts of IFNγ and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The consequences of this dysregulated pro-inflammatory response in the synovium include impaired tissue repair, vascular damage, autoimmune and cytotoxic processes, and fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. These synovial characteristics are similar to those in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, post-infectious Lyme arthritis provides a model for other chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory arthritides in which complex immune responses can be triggered and shaped by an infectious agent in concert with host genetic factors. Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of Lyme disease, can sometimes persist in a chronic post-infectious disease. In this Review, the authors argue that post-infectious Lyme arthritis could act as a model to improve understanding of other forms of chronic arthritis. A combination of spirochaetal and host genetic factors shape the outcome of Lyme arthritis, which ranges from mild, antibiotic-responsive joint inflammation to persistent, antibiotic-refractory autoinflammatory or autoimmune synovitis. Certain highly inflammatory strains of Borrelia burgdorferi most commonly found in north-eastern USA are present at an increased frequency among patients who subsequently develop post-infectious Lyme arthritis. The histology of post-infectious Lyme arthritis synovia is similar to that in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis, but there is greater microvascular damage in Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi is no longer present in synovia after treatment with antibiotics, but B. burgdorferi peptidoglycan might persist and could be an important promoter of innate immune responses. Dysregulated, excessive IFNγ responses and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are a central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis, and contribute to persistent inflammation and the development of autoimmunity. Synovial fibroblasts, the most common cell in the synovial lesion, become immune effector cells capable of altering the innate and adaptive immune microenvironment in Lyme arthritis.']","['Lochhead, Robert B., [Strle, Klemen], [Arvikar, Sheila L.], [Weis, Janis J.], [Steere, Allen C.]']",['10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],[''],"['Lyme arthritis: linking infection, inflammation and autoimmunity']"

With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"

By contrast, ionic strength did not have an effect on binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16. Of relevance, plasminogen bound to the borrelial protein cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2251 upon conversion by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPa), demonstrating it retained its physiological activity. Interestingly, further analyses revealed a complement inhibitory activity of Vlp15/16 and Vlp18 on the alternative pathway by a Factor H-independent mechanism.

"['Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK–STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host. Borrelia burgdorferi has a complex life cycle with several different hosts, causing Lyme disease when it infects humans.

Twenty genospecies compose Bbsl currently, and with the exception of Borrelia chilensis , and Borrelia garinii , all have been described only for North America, Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Here, we collected specimens of Ixodes paranaensis , a tick associated with swifts in a Brazilian natural park from the state of Minas Gerais, and performed a molecular characterization of 11 borrelial genes.

We used the double robust approach of stabilized inverse probability weighting and propensity score adjustment to obtain ORs. Approximately 5% of participants (n\u2009=\u2009142) self-reported TBD diagnosis. Practicing different PPMs ranged from 48% for treating outdoor clothing with special bug-spray to 83% for walking on established trails.

In stratified analyses, TBD knowledge, safety worry because of ticks, avoiding outdoors because of ticks, and pet TBD risk modified the associations between different PPMs and self-reported TBD diagnosis. In the state of Indiana, thorough body/clothes check after being outdoors and use of insect repellent on exposed skin might be strongly effective in preventing TBD. The protective effect of different PPMs might be stronger among people with high TBD knowledge, high safety worry because of ticks, high avoidance of being outdoors because of ticks, and low pet TBD risk.

"['Background Impact of climate change on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle in a given region depends on how the region-specific climate change patterns influence tick population development processes and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission dynamics involving both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes. Predicting the transmission risk of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with projected climate conditions is essential for planning public health interventions including vaccination programs to mitigate the TBE incidence in the inhabitants and travelers. We have previously developed and validated a mathematical model for retroactive analysis of weather fluctuation on TBE prevalence in Hungary, and we aim to show in this research that this model provides an effective tool for projecting TBEV transmission risk in the enzootic cycle. Methods Using the established model of TBEV transmission and the climate predictions of the Vas county in western Hungary in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, we quantify the risk of TBEV transmission using a series of summative indices - the basic reproduction number, the duration of infestation, the stage-specific tick densities, and the accumulated (tick) infections due to co-feeding transmission. We also measure the significance of co-feeding transmission by observing the cumulative number of new transmissions through the non-systemic transmission route. Results The transmission potential and the risk in the study site are expected to increase along with the increase of the temperature in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. This increase will be facilitated by the expected extension of the tick questing season and the increase of the numbers of susceptible ticks (larval and nymphal) and the number of infected nymphal ticks co-feeding on the same hosts, leading to compounded increase of infections through the non-systemic transmission. Conclusions The developed mathematical model provides an effective tool for predicting TBE prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle, by integrating climate projection with emerging knowledge about the region-specific tick ecological and pathogen enzootic processes (through model parametrization fitting to historical data). Model projects increasing co-feeding transmission and prevalence of TBEV in a recognized TBE endemic region, so human risk of TBEV infection is likely increasing unless public health interventions are enhanced.']","['Nah, Kyeongah, [Bede-Fazekas, Ákos], [Trájer, Attila János], [Wu, Jianhong]']",['10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],[''],['The potential impact of climate change on the transmission risk of tick-borne encephalitis in Hungary']

Furthermore, mixed infections with multiple microorganisms further complicate and limit the detection potential of traditional diagnostic methods. The present study investigated the tick-borne microorganisms in bovine ticks in Pakistan, employing a high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR based technique. Methods Ticks were collected from clinically healthy cattle ( n \xa0=\xa0116) and water buffaloes ( n \xa0=\xa088) from 30 villages across six districts located in five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Pakistan from September to November 2017. The microfluidic real-time PCR was used to test the genomic DNA of individual ticks for the presence of 27 bacterial and eight parasitic microorganisms. Phylogenetic methods were used to assess the genetic relationship of DNA sequences determined herein. Results PCR detected DNA of at least one microorganism in each of 221 ticks tested (94.4%, 221/234). DNA-based detection inferred that single pathogens/endosymbionts were the most common (43.4%, 96/221) followed by double (38.9%, 86/221), triple (14.5%, 32/221), quadruple (2.3%, 5/221) and quintuple (0.9%, 2/221) mixed infections. Piroplasms ( Babesia / Theileria spp.) were the most prevalent (31.6%, 74/234), followed by Ehrlichia spp. (20%, 47/234) and Anaplasma marginale (7.7%, 18/234). Anaplasma phagocytophilum , A. ovis , A. centrale , Babesia ovis , Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., R. massiliae , Bartonella spp. and Hepatozoon spp. were also detected. Endosymbionts such as Francisella -like (91.5%, 214/234) and Coxiella -like (1.3%, 3/234) organisms were also detected in ticks. The highest diversity of microorganisms was detected in Hyalomma anatolicum ticks (test-positive for 14/14 microorganisms), followed by Rhipicephalus microplus (4/14), Hy. hussaini (3/14) and Rh. annulatus (2/14).

All available structures from the genus Borrelia represent proteins expressed without a membrane-targeting signal peptide, thus avoiding conserved pathways that modify, fold and assemble membrane protein complexes. Towards elucidating structure and function of these critical proteins, we directed translocation of eleven expression-optimized Bb virulence factors, including the signal sequence, to the Escherichia coli membrane, of which five, BBA57, HtrA, BB0238, BB0323, and DipA, were expressed with C-terminal His-tags.

Previous studies showed multiple critical roles of BBA57 in transmission, joint arthritis, carditis, weakening immune responses, and regulating other Bb outer surface proteins.

"['Background The evolutionary history of a species is frequently derived from molecular sequences, and the resulting phylogenetic trees do not include explicit functional information. Here, we aimed to assess the functional relationships among bacteria in the Spirochaetes phylum, based on the biological processes of 42,489 proteins in reference proteomes of 34 Spirochaetes species. We tested the hypothesis that the species in the genus Borrelia might be sufficiently different to warrant splitting them into two separate genera. Results A detrended canonical analysis demonstrated that the presence/absence of biological processes among selected bacteria contained a strong phylogenetic signal, which did not separate species of Borrelia . We examined the ten biological processes in which most proteins were involved consistently. This analysis demonstrated that species in Borrelia were more similar to each other than to free-life species ( Sediminispirochaeta , Spirochaeta , Sphaerochaeta ) or to pathogenic species without vectors ( Leptospira , Treponema, Brachyspira ), which are highly divergent. A dendrogram based on the presence/absence of proteins in the reference proteomes demonstrated that distances between species of the same genus among free-life or pathogenic non-vector species were higher than the distances between the 19 species (27 strains) of Borrelia . A phyloproteomic network supported the close functional association between species of Borrelia . In the proteome of 27 strains of Borrelia , only a few proteins had evolved separately, in the relapsing fever and Lyme borreliosis groups. The most prominent Borrelia proteins and processes were a subset of those also found in free-living and non-vectored pathogenic species. In addition, the functional innovation (i.e., unique biological processes or proteins) of Borrelia was very low, compared to other genera of Spirochaetes. Conclusions We found only marginal functional differences among Borrelia species. Phyloproteomic networks that included all pairwise combinations between species, proteins, and processes were more effective than other methods for evaluating the evolutionary relationships among taxa.

"['Background Borrelia sp. is a causative pathogen of Lyme disease which has become a worldwide health concern. Non-toxic approaches especially directed toward latent persistent forms of this pathogen are desired. Lipids in the form of volatile and non-volatile oils, and fatty acids with proven anti-borreliae efficacy could become an additional support or an alternative for consideration in treatment approaches. Methods In this study we investigated 47 lipids (30 volatile and non-volatile oils, and 17 fatty acids) of plant and animal origin against typical motile, knob/round-shaped persisters, and biofilm-like aggregates of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. and Borrelia garinii , which are identified as pathogenic factors of Lyme disease in the USA and Europe, using direct microscopic counting and spectrofluorometric measurements. Results Out of all examined lipids, 5 oils (Bay leaf oil, Birch oil, Cassia oil, Chamomile oil German, and Thyme oil) at or below 0.25%, and 3 fatty acids (13Z,16Z Docosadienoic acid, erucic acid, and petroselinic acid) at or below 0.75\u2009mg/ml, showed bactericidal activity against typical motile spirochetes and knob/round-shaped persisters. Only Bay leaf oil and Cassia oil, including their major constituents, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, showed to target biofilm-like aggregates of both tested Borrelia spp. at the same concentration , although with 20–30% eradication mark. Conclusion Based on obtained results, volatile oils were more potent than non-volatile oils, and unsaturated fatty acids were more effective than saturated fatty acids.

"['Background With approximately one-third of their genomes consisting of linear and circular plasmids, the Lyme disease agent cluster of species has the most complex genomes among known bacteria. We report here a comparative analysis of plasmids in eleven Borreliella (also known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) species. Results We sequenced the complete genomes of two B. afzelii, two B. garinii, and individual B. spielmanii , B. bissettiae, B. valaisiana and B. finlandensis isolates. These individual isolates carry between seven and sixteen plasmids, and together harbor 99 plasmids. We report here a comparative analysis of these plasmids, along with 70 additional Borreliella plasmids available in the public sequence databases. We identify only one new putative plasmid compatibility type (the 30th) among these 169 plasmid sequences, suggesting that all or nearly all such types have now been discovered. We find that the linear plasmids in the non- B. burgdorferi species have undergone the same kinds of apparently random, chaotic rearrangements mediated by non-homologous recombination that we previously discovered in B. burgdorferi . These rearrangements occurred independently in the different species lineages, and they, along with an expanded chromosomal phylogeny reported here, allow the identification of several whole plasmid transfer events among these species. Phylogenetic analyses of the plasmid partition genes show that a majority of the plasmid compatibility types arose early, most likely before separation of the Lyme agent Borreliella and relapsing fever Borrelia clades, and this, with occasional cross species plasmid transfers, has resulted in few if any species-specific or geographic region-specific Borreliella plasmid types. Conclusions The primordial origin and persistent maintenance of the Borreliella plasmid types support their functional indispensability as well as evolutionary roles in facilitating genome diversity. The improved resolution of Borreliella plasmid phylogeny based on conserved partition-gene clusters will lead to better determination of gene orthology which is essential for prediction of biological function, and it will provide a basis for inferring detailed evolutionary mechanisms of Borreliella genomic variability including homologous gene and plasmid exchanges as well as non-homologous rearrangements.']","['Casjens, Sherwood R., [Di, Lia], [Akther, Saymon], [Mongodin, Emmanuel F.], [Luft, Benjamin J.], [Schutzer, Steven E.], [Fraser, Claire M.], [Qiu, Wei-Gang]']",['10.1186/s12864-018-4597-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4597-x'],[''],['Primordial origin and diversification of plasmids in Lyme disease agent bacteria']

The aim of the study was to evaluate main tick-borne disease risk factors in natural, endemic areas of north-east (NE) Poland (Białowieża) and urban areas of central Poland (Warsaw), measuring tick abundance/density, prevalence of infection with spirochaetes and diversity of these pathogens in spring-early summer and late summer-autumn periods between 2012 and 2015. Methods Questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from three urban sites in Warsaw, central Poland and three natural sites in Białowieża, NE Poland. A total of 2993 ticks were analyzed for the presence of Borreliella spp. and/or Borrelia miyamotoi DNA by PCR. Tick abundance was analyzed by General Linear Models (GLM). Prevalence and distribution of spirochaetes was analyzed by Maximum Likelihood techniques based on log-linear analysis of contingency tables (HILOGLINEAR).

Prevalence of spirochaetes was significantly higher in the summer-autumn period than in the spring-early summer [15.0% (95% CI: 12.8–17.5%) vs 10.4% (95% CI: 9.2–11.6%), respectively]. We have detected six species of bacteria present in both types of areas, with different frequencies: dominance of B. afzelii (69.3%) in urban and B. garinii (48.1%) in natural areas. Although we observed higher tick densities in forests than in maintained parks, the prevalence of spirochaetes was significantly higher in the latter [9.8% (95% CI: 8.6–11.0%) vs 17.5% (95% CI: 14.4–20.5%)]. Conclusions Surprisingly, a similar risk of infection with Borreliella spp. and/or B. miyamotoi was discovered in highly- and low-transformed areas. We suggest that the awareness of presence of these disease agents in cities should be raised.']","['Kowalec, Maciej, [Szewczyk, Tomasz], [Welc-Falęciak, Renata], [Siński, Edward], [Karbowiak, Grzegorz], [Bajer, Anna]']",['10.1186/s13071-017-2391-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2391-2'],[''],['Ticks and the city - are there any differences between city parks and natural forests in terms of tick abundance and prevalence of spirochaetes?']

"['In today’s global economy and affordable vacation travel, it is increasingly important that visitors to another country and their physician be familiar with emerging infections, infections unique to a specific geographic region, and risks related to the process of travel. This is never more important than for patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD). A recent review addressing common causes of fever in travelers provides important information for the general population Thwaites and Day (N Engl J Med 376:548-560, 2017 ). This review covers critical infectious and management concerns specifically related to travel for patients with PIDD. This review will discuss the context of the changing landscape of infections, highlight specific infections of concern, and profile distinct infection phenotypes in patients who are immune compromised. The organization of this review will address the environment driving emerging infections and several concerns unique to patients with PIDD. The first section addresses general considerations, the second section profiles specific infections organized according to mechanism of transmission, and the third section focuses on unique phenotypes and unique susceptibilities in patients with PIDDs. This review does not address most parasitic diseases.

"['The classic genome organization of the bacterial chromosome is normally envisaged with all its genetic markers linked, thus forming a closed genetic circle of duplex stranded DNA (dsDNA) and several proteins in what it is called as “the bacterial nucleoid.” This structure may be more or less corrugated depending on the physiological state of the bacterium (i.e., resting state or active growth) and is not surrounded by a double membrane as in eukayotic cells. The universality of the closed circle model in bacteria is however slowly changing, as new data emerge in different bacterial groups such as in Planctomycetes and related microorganisms, species of Borrelia , Streptomyces , Agrobacterium , or Phytoplasma . In these and possibly other microorganisms, the existence of complex formations of intracellular membranes or linear chromosomes is typical; all of these situations contributing to weakening the current cellular organization paradigm, i.e., prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cells.']","['Feijoo-Siota, Lucía, [Rama, José Luis R.], [Sánchez-Pérez, Angeles], [Villa, Tomás G.]']",['10.1007/s00253-017-8381-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8381-7'],[''],['Considerations on bacterial nucleoids']
"['Background Borrelia mayonii is currently the latest species belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) complex to be discovered. Interestingly it is involved in human pathology causing a high fever. We looked for its presence in post- tick bite febrile patients as well as in Ixodes ricinus ticks in an endemic area of France. Results After ensuring that our molecular technics correctly detected B. mayonii , 575 patients and 3,122 Ixodes ricinus nymphs were tested. Neither B. mayonii nor another species of the B. burgdorferi ( s.l .) complex previously not reported in Europe has been identified. Conclusions For now, B. mayonii seems to be an epiphenomenon.

"['The causal agents of Lyme disease in North America, Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii , are transmitted primarily by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Due to their limited metabolic capacity, spirochetes rely on the tick blood meal for nutrients and metabolic intermediates while residing in the tick vector, competing with the tick for nutrients in the blood meal. Metabolomics is an effective methodology to explore dynamics of spirochete survival and multiplication in tick vectors before transmission to a vertebrate host via tick saliva. Using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified statistically significant differences in the metabolic profile among uninfected I. scapularis nymphal ticks, B. burgdorferi -infected nymphal ticks and B. mayonii -infected nymphal ticks by measuring metabolism every 24\u2009hours over the course of their up to 96\u2009hour blood meals. Specifically, differences in the abundance of purines, amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids during the blood meal among the three groups of nymphal ticks suggest that B. mayonii and B. burgdorferi may have different metabolic capabilities, especially during later stages of nymphal feeding. Understanding mechanisms underlying variable metabolic requirements of different Lyme disease spirochetes within tick vectors could potentially aid development of novel methods to control spirochete transmission.']","['Hoxmeier, J.

"['Background The Ehrlichia muris -like agent (EMLA) is a newly recognized human pathogen in the North Central United States. Although blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) have been identified as capable vectors, wild reservoirs have not yet been established for EMLA. As key hosts for I. scapularis , white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) are important reservoirs for various tick-borne pathogens, and potentially, for EMLA. The objective of this study was to evaluate reservoir competence in P. leucopus using a natural vector. Results Mice acquired EMLA infection from feeding ticks and were able to transmit infection to naïve ticks. Transmission between simultaneously feeding tick life stages was also demonstrated. Infections in mice were acute and severe, with systemic dissemination. Limited host survival and clearance of infection among survivors resulted in a narrow interval where EMLA could be acquired by feeding ticks. Conclusions Peromyscus leucopus is a competent reservoir of EMLA and likely to play a role in its enzootic transmission cycle. The duration and severity of EMLA infection in these hosts suggests that tick phenology is a critical factor determining the geographic distribution of EMLA in North America.']","['Lynn, Geoffrey E., [Oliver, Jonathan D.], [Cornax, Ingrid], [O’Sullivan, M.

He also recommends a policy to adopt mobile phones for use as both the technology solution and access devices solution, and adds that renewable energy solutions, particularly solar energy, must be advanced to ensure availability of electricity for all residents, a necessity for education and skill development.']","['Sebusang, S.']",['10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68458-7_27'],[''],['Cloud-Based Solutions for Education and Skill Development – Botswana']
"['Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can enhance understanding of global biodiversity by making it possible to study taxonomic groups that are difficult to sample. However, experimental choices made when generating eDNA data can impact biodiversity surveys and must be carefully considered during study design. Here, we explored the impact of DNA extraction protocol and metabarcode choice on recovery of meiofauna DNA from sand. We extracted DNA from untreated sand and from sand treated with either Ludox or MgCl 2 and amplified DNA using the 18S and CO1 metabarcodes. We found differences in species composition and richness both between metabarcodes and among sampling strategies, confirming the sensitivity of the experiments to both parameters. Combining data from multiple barcodes and from multiple extraction protocols increased recovered meiofaunal taxonomic diversity. Future metabarcoding studies and meta-analyses should consider the effects of sampling protocols on biodiversity. Our results also highlight the need to continue to improve existing reference databases of morphological and molecular characterization of meiofauna, in particular of the tropics, which are poorly represented in existing databases.']","['Castro, Lyda R., [Meyer, Rachel S.], [Shapiro, Beth], [Shirazi, Sabrina], [Cutler, Samuel], [Lagos, Ana M.], [Quiroga, Sigmer Y.]']",['10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04576-z'],[''],['Metabarcoding meiofauna biodiversity assessment in four beaches of Northern Colombia: effects of sampling protocols and primer choice']
"['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted great attentions over the past few decades due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Crystallization is sought in many application fields since it allows enhancing or even promoting properties of catalysis, energy storage and photoelectric properties. However, the crystallization process of nanostructured COFs remains to be challenging. Synthetic approaches to establish nucleation and elongation growth of COFs for controlling crystallization have drawn substantial amount of attentions. Nanostructured COFs have exhibited significant advantages when applied in (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices as well. In this review, recent progress in precisely design strategy of fabricating various nanostructured COFs and their applications as (electro)photocatalyzer and energy storage devices are summarized. After a brief introduction of the design principles, composition and interior architecture, the morphology of nanostructured COFs including porous and mesoporous stacked-layer structure, nanosheet structure, nanorod structure, ordered stripe arrays and various nanocomposites are thoroughly described. Reactions dedicated to crystallization process for two-dimensional (2D) COFs are discussed further. Then, the applications of nanostructured COFs as (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges for the synthetic technology of nanostructured COFs materials are particularly discussed. Personal insights into the challenges and opportunities on pursuing topologies as hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk–shell structures were raised to broaden the applications.']","['Chen, Haoyun, [Yuan, Xingzhong], [Wang, Hou], [Yu, Hanbo], [Jiang, Longbo]']",['10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05872-8'],[''],['Nanostructured covalent organic frameworks with elevated crystallization for (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices']
"['According to modern classification, tick-borne flaviviruses have been divided into a mammalian tick-borne virus group and a seabird tick-borne virus group (STBVG). The STBVG includes the Tyuleniy virus, Meaban virus, Saumarez Reef virus, and the recently discovered Kama virus (KAMV). The latter was isolated from Ixodes lividus , an obligate parasitic tick of the sand martin ( Riparia riparia ), in 1989 in the central part of the Russian Plain. In 2014, based on molecular genetic analysis, it was shown that KAMV is a new virus belonging to STBVG, genus Flavivirus , fam. Flaviviridae . Very little is known about the Kama virus concerning its range, vectors, and reservoir hosts. GenBank contains a single sequence of the complete genome of this virus. In the present study, the complete genome sequences of two strains, isolated in 1983 in the Omsk region (Western Siberia) from gamasid mites in the nests of rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ), have been determined. Phylogenetic analyses of their genomes showed a close relationship both with each other (approx. 98.9% nucleotide identity) and with KAMV isolated in European Russia (approx. 98.4% nucleotide identity). The ecological features of KAMV that are due to the species of the vector (gamasid mites) and its hosts (colonial birds of the mainland of Eurasia) indicate that KAMV is an atypical representative STBVG.']","['Kovalev, S.

Our analysis is based on administrative county-level data on vaccination purchases linked to indicators of media coverage of the meningococcal disease and to administrative records of disease incidence.

"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 117:32493, 2020a), where we reported that BCP/BCPO (beta-caryophyllene/caryophyllene oxide) in fresh horse manure is sufficient to drive manure rolling behavior (HMR) in giant panda and attenuate the cold sensitivity of mice by directly targeting and inhibiting transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), an archetypical cold-activated ion channel of mammals. The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']
"['Probability of informed trading (PIN) models characterize trading with certain types of information through a tree structure. Different tree structures with different numbers of groups for market participants have been proposed, with no clear, consistent tree used in the literature. One of the main causes of this inconsistency is that these trees are artificially proposed through a bottom-up approach rather than implied by actual market data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that infers a tree structure directly from empirical data. More precisely, we use hierarchical clustering to construct a tree for each individual firm and then infer an aggregate tree through a voting mechanism. We test this method on US data from January 2002 for 7608 companies, which results in a tree with two layers and four groups. The characteristics of the resulting aggregate tree are between those of several proposed tree structures in the literature, demonstrating that these proposed trees all reflect only part of the market, and one should consider the proposed empirically driven method when seeking a tree representing the whole market.']","['Lin, Emily, [Kao, Chu-Lan Michael], [Adityarini, Natasha Sonia]']",['10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],[''],['Data-driven tree structure for PIN models']
"['The aim of this study was to explore the associations between temperamental reactivity and regulation and the emergence of anxiety traits in a longitudinal sample of infants enriched for later ASD. Parents of 143 infants who were at high- and low-risk for ASD rated their child’s temperament traits when they were 9, 15 and 24\xa0months old; they rated anxiety and ASD traits when they were 36\xa0months old. The findings suggest that behavioural inhibition may be an early predictor of later anxiety in children with and without ASD and that lower levels of effortful control in children who later develop ASD may contribute to the higher expression of anxiety within this population.']","['Ersoy, Mutluhan, [Charman, Tony], [Pasco, Greg], [Carr, Ewan], [Johnson, Mark H.], [Jones, Emily J.

"['Mating with the wrong species is surprisingly common in nature. Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

"['Free-ranging giant pandas ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) in China recently were reported to rub and roll in horse manure, a behavior that was observed frequently at low ambient temperatures.

Mice\xa0and rats treated with BCP/BCPO exhibited enhanced cold tolerance in behavioral assays, and BCP/BCPO inhibited cold-activated ion channels of mammals expressed in human kidney cells; these laboratory results were cited in support of the contention that giant pandas tolerate low ambient temperatures by applying horse manure to their integument. The demonstrated biocidal activities of BCP and BCPO against insects and ticks, and the reported elicitation of anointing in giant pandas with materials other than horse manure, including substances or constituents thereof known to act as arthropod biocides, are consistent with an anti-consumer function of anointing by giant pandas.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions.

Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Purpose Women’s worry about developing breast cancer may influence their decision to use preventive therapy. However, the direction of this relationship has been questioned. We prospectively investigated the relationship between breast cancer worry and uptake of preventive therapy. The socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with high breast cancer worry were also investigated. Methods Women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited from clinics across England ( n \u2009=\u2009408). Participants completed a survey on their breast cancer worry, socio-demographic and clinical factors. Uptake of tamoxifen was recorded at 3\xa0months ( n \u2009=\u2009258 women, 63.2%). Both primary and sensitivity analyses were conducted using different classifications of low, medium and high worry. Results 39.5% of respondents reported medium breast cancer worry at baseline and 21.2% reported high worry. Ethnic minority women were more likely to report high worry than white women (OR\u2009=\u20093.02, 95%CI 1.02, 8.91, p \u2009=\u20090.046). Women educated below degree level were more likely to report high worry than those with higher education (OR\u2009=\u20092.29, 95%CI 1.28, 4.09, p \u2009=\u20090.005). No statistically significant association was observed between worry and uptake.

"['Aims CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes. It is currently unclear whether daily glucose variability contributes to CVD. Therefore, we investigated whether glucose variability is associated with arterial measures that are considered important in CVD pathogenesis. Methods We included participants of The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort, who underwent at least 48\xa0h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ( n \u2009=\u2009853; age: 59.9\u2009±\u20098.6\xa0years; 49% women, 23% type 2 diabetes). We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

This survey was created to illuminate which and how qMRI techniques are currently applied across Europe. Methods In total, 4753 neuroradiologists from 27 countries received an online questionnaire. Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85). QIBA and EIBALL were not well known (12.5%, n = 34, and 11.0%, n = 30). Conclusions The clinical implementation of qMRI methods is highly variable. Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']
"['Experimental closure of the surface energy balance during convective periods is a long-standing problem. With experimental data from the Idealized horizontal Planar Array experiment for Quantifying Surface heterogeneity, the terms of the temperature-tendency equation are computed, with an emphasis on the total derivative. The experiment occurred at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test facility at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground during the summer of 2019. The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ).

A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings.

The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001).

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"

"['The large integration of variable energy resources is expected to shift a large part of the energy exchanges closer to real-time, where more accurate forecasts are available. In this context, the short-term electricity markets and in particular the intraday market are considered a suitable trading floor for these exchanges to occur. A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']

CIM-seq is based on RNA sequencing of incompletely dissociated cells, followed by computational deconvolution into constituent cell types. CIM-seq estimates parameters such as number of cells and cell types in each multiplet directly from sequencing data, making it compatible with high-throughput droplet-based methods. When applied to gut epithelium or whole dissociated lung and spleen, CIM-seq correctly identifies known interactions, including those between different cell lineages and immune cells. In the colon, CIM-seq identifies a previously unrecognized goblet cell subtype expressing the wound-healing marker Plet1 , which is directly adjacent to colonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that CIM-seq is broadly applicable to unsupervised profiling of cell-type interactions in different tissue types.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum . This study provides crucial information for ungulate management as a tool to mitigate zoonotic disease risk and argues for adapting management approaches to the local ungulate species composition and the pathogen(s) of concern.

Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks play a vital role as vectors in the transmission of Anaplasma pathogens. However, the Anaplasma species carried by H. longicornis in China are yet to be characterized. In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools. All tick sample pools were examined for the presence of Anaplasma species via nested PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA, major surface protein 4 ( msp4 ), or citric acid synthase ( gltA ) genes, which were sequenced to determine the molecular and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolates. The overall Anaplasma spp-positive rate of H. longicornis was determined to be 26.68% (99/371). The percentage prevalence of A. phagocytophilum -like1, A. bovis , A. ovis , A. marginale , and A. capra were 1.08% (4/371), 13.21% (49/371), 13.21% (49/371), 1.35% (5/371), and 10.24% (38/371), respectively, and the co-infection rate of two or more types of Anaplasma was 6.47% (24/371). Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of A. phagocytophilum into an A. phagocytophilum -like1 ( Anaplasma sp. Japan) group. Anaplasma bovis sequences obtained in this study were 99.8–100% identical to those of an earlier strain isolated from a Chinese tick (GenBank accession no. KP314251). Anaplasma ovis sequences showed 99.3–99.6% identity to an A. ovis human strain identified from a Cypriot patient (GenBank accession no. FJ460443). Only one msp4 sequence of A. marginale was detected and was grouped with those of other A. marginale isolates, and these A. capra isolates obtained in this present study may be zoonotic. The detection and characterization of four Anaplasma species in H. longicornis in this study have added to the current knowledge of the parasite and provided data on multiple Anaplasma species with veterinary and medical significance from four provinces of China.']","['Yan, Yaqun, [Wang, Kunlun], [Cui, Yanyan], [Zhou, Yongchun], [Zhao, Shanshan], [Zhang, Yajun], [Jian, Fuchun], [Wang, Rongjun], [Zhang, Longxian], [Ning, Changshen]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93629-3'],[''],['Molecular detection and phylogenetic analyses of Anaplasma spp. in Haemaphysalis longicornis from goats in four provinces of China']
"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks. We believe that this approach will aid in large-scale pathogen screening of arthropods to be used in vector-borne disease control programs.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease.

Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases.

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world. Conclusions Despite holding much significance to the animal sector, comprehensive disease mapping has yet not been undertaken in several parts of India. The present study provides a blue print of disease mapping, epidemiological correlations and genomic diversity of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata circulating in the region.']","['Kaur, Rabjot, [Yadav, Anish], [Rafiqi, Shafiya I.], [Godara, Rajesh], [Sudan, Vikrant], [Chakraborty, D.], [Katoch, Rajesh]']",['10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02915-9'],[''],"['Epidemiology, haematology and molecular characterization of haemoprotozoon and rickettsial organisms causing infections in cattle of Jammu region, North India']"

"['Introduction Anaplasma sp. is an obligatory intracellular Gram-negative tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are the drugs of choice for treating domestic animals with acute anaplasmosis. Lack of documented information about oxytetracycline resistance in Anaplasma species in the world was the scope of this study to screen by PCR for the detection of the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in Anaplasma species from infected cattle and sheep in the Northwest and Southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods Total of 100 cattle and sheep blood samples collected from 2 provinces in the Northwest and 1 province in the Southwest of Iran were tested microscopically by the Giemsa staining examination and confirmed by PCR. Then the presence of two different oxytetracycline-resistance genes ( otrA, and otrB ) was detected by PCR in positive samples. Results The results showed that 60% of Anaplasma -infected samples were identified to have an otrA -resistance gene, and 26.67% had an otrB -resistance gene. The coexistence of two oxytetracycline-resistance determinants was encountered in 13.33% of the isolates. The significant difference in the frequency of otr genes was found among three Anaplasma species ( A. marginale , A. centrale and A. ovis ), and among three studied regions in Iran ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The identified sequences were submitted to the GenBank and deposited under accession numbers MN880729 and MN895439 for otrB and otrA genes.

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']
"['Ticks will diminish productivity among farm animals and transmit zoonotic diseases. We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%). Among all ticks, 32 (11%) were positive for Rickettsia spp. and 15 (5.2%) of these were identified as R. africae comprising at least two genetic clades, occurring in A. variegatum (n\u2009=\u200910) and A. cohaerens (n\u2009=\u20095).

The authors suspect that because the zoo differs in its sanitary and veterinary conditions from those found in nature, the results obtained here may differ markedly from those existing in the natural environment. Although we cannot be certain at this stage that the mites did not carry other pathogens in addition to those that were detectable by the primers that were used, the erythematous reaction to bite marks likely reflects a response to secretions of the mites rather than to transmitted pathogens.']","['Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta, [Gwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00791-0'],[''],"['Do ectoparasites of the slow loris Nycticebus pygmaeus, pose a danger to humans?']"
"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis.

"['Background Various tick-borne infections like borreliosis and rickettsiosis pose a health risk to humans in many parts of the world. We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. Methods Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. Results Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. Conclusions Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti- Borrelia -antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years. Rickettsiosis is of limited concern in Denmark.

The aim of this study is to screen the important tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) carried by hard ticks in Inner Mongolia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and to estimate the risk of human infection imposed by tick bites. Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level. Individual tick DNA samples were detected by genus--specific or group-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these TBPs and combined with DNA sequencing assay to confirm the results of mNGS. Results R. raoultii (45.32%, 92/203), Candidatus R. tarasevichiae (5.42%, 11/203), Anaplasma sp.

"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals. Conclusions Most of the studied pathogenic agents are present in the prospected area, indicating a possible risk for both human and animal health.

"['Background Canine babesiosis and anaplasmosis, caused by Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , respectively, are significant tick-borne diseases in Baltic countries. Both diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of clinicopathological findings, by direct pathogen detection in blood smears or by indirect pathogen detection; however, because of high selectivity and specificity, molecular methods may be advantageous. The goal of this study was to develop a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase, (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and serum protein profiles in dogs affected with naturally acquired ehrlichiosis. Methods The animal materials had been consisted of ten dogs naturally infected with Ehrlichia canis , and ten controls negative for Ehrlichia canis . TAC, MDA, NO, SOD, GSH-Px, ADA activity and TP, ALB, GLOB levels were measured in sera of the animals. The serum protein concentrations were measured by autoanalyzer. The electrophoretic profiles of serum total protein were determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Native-PAGE). Results In dogs with ehrlichiosis, decreased TAC ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GSH-Px ( P \u2009>\u20090.05) levels were determined. However, NO ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), SOD ( P \u2009<\u20090.05), ADA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), MDA ( P \u2009>\u20090.05), TP ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) and GLO ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) levels were found as increased in the Ehrlichia positive dogs.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites and transmit various types of protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases in a wild as well as domestic animals and humans globally. Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

"['The aim of this study is to make aware every one of the deadliest diseases named severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). It has become the worldwide pandemic in recent few years. It is a kind of haemorrhagic fever, caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel phlebovirus of family Bunyaviridae. This syndrome is also a tick-borne zoonosis that means the virus transmitted from tick bite (having virus) into human body, i.e. infection spread from animals to humans and also transmitted from human to human. Epidemiological data of SFTS was collected to know the nature/symptoms of SFTSV. First case of this disease has been reported in China, followed by Japan, South korea, Taiwan, USA and many other countries. Vertebrates are the host of this disease and tick functions as a vector, where the virus can undergo brisk changes using gene mutation, homologous recombination and reassortments. The major symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Sometimes in very severe cases, full body organ failure may also take place and average death rate in humans is nearly 10\u2009%. Old aged peoples are more prone to SFTSV infection. Apart from the fact of increasing SFTSV related health problems to humans, the pathogenesis of SFTS virus in human is not entirely understood and no treatment to this virus is still available. The simplest way to protect our self from this infection is to refrain from tick bite. Therefore, this disease has evolved to produce serious health issues to humans in various countries of world including china.

"['Background Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a serious threat to humans, wildlife and livestock, and cause severe economic losses in many tropical drylands. The effective control of TBDs has been constrained by limited understanding of what determines tick loads in animals. We tested interactive effects of several biological factors (sex, age and body condition), one environmental factor (rainfall) and one human factor (management type) on tick loads in animals. Methods We collected ticks on animals at four sampling sites in the semi-arid savanna area of Laikipia County, Kenya, of which two are commercial ranches and the other two are open pastoral grazing areas. From 2017 to 2019, we collected a total of 2038 ticks from 619 domestic animals from various cattle and camel herds and from 79 tranquilised wild animals. Results Generally, wild herbivores (zebras, rhinos and elephants) had higher tick loads than domestic animals. As 83% of the tick samples were taken from Boran cattle, we analysed tick load in these cattle in more detail. Boran cattle had high tick loads in the wet season, especially those animals in poor condition. No differences were found between female and male cattle, regardless of season. The calves had high tick loads during both the wet and dry seasons, whereas the sub-adult and adult cattle had less ticks during the dry season. Cattle on the intensively managed ranches had lower tick load than those in the transhumant management system. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of establishing effective control of ticks on domestic animals in transhumant management systems as tick loads were high on these animals in both the wet and dry season.

Adult and larval tick DNA were amplified by PCR and later sequenced to identify mutations, if any, in the domain II S4-5 linker and domain III S6 regions in para voltage-gated sodium channel gene, at loci that were previously documented to be associated with deltamethrin resistance. Allele-specific PCR was performed for the amplification of target gene locus (C190A and T2134C) to genotype 1000 larvae each, at these loci. Genotype frequency was statistically analysed by Chi-square test. Results Bioassay using LPT revealed that LC 50 and LC 95 values of all the R. (B.) microplus isolates in this study were more than double the reported values of reference susceptible strain. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons of domain II S4-5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene revealed C190A mutation, A271G mutation as well as A–G mutation at 217th position. AS-PCR done to genotype C190A mutations revealed a frequency of 6%, 15% and 64%, respectively for homozygous-susceptible (SS), heterozygous (RS) and homozygous-resistant (RR) genotypes. In domain III S6 region of the gene, C2121T and A2102T mutations were observed. AS-PCR to genotype the previously reported T2134C mutation revealed 100% SS genotype in R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala. Conclusions Genotyping of R. (B.) microplus isolates of Kerala for target site mutations reportedly associated with deltamethrin resistance revealed a significantly high frequency of resistant genotypes at II S4–5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene. This study forms the first report of such mutations in Kerala, south India and demands serious attention in the light of increased prevalence of tick-borne haemoparasitic infection.']","['Amrutha, Anand, [Bindu, Lakshmanan], [Siju, J.], [Aravindakshan, T.

A standard indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was used to determine antibodies to Babesia bigemina , Babesia bovis , and Ehrlichia ruminantium and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for antibodies to Anaplasma marginale detection. The highest tick loads were observed on cattle during the hot-wet and post-rainy seasons and lowest during the cool-dry season. The E. ruminantium prevalence in Elundini was 16% and 14% in post-rainy and hot-dry seasons respectively and 15% at Senqu during the post-rainy season.

"['Objectives Although there are promising studies on cancer treatment, it is still a frightening disease. For effective treatment, an integrative and positive perspective is required. Using the power of metaphors to facilitate understanding of complex and intangible ideas, this study aims to define cancer from the perspective of Turkish nursing students. Sample and Setting This study was conducted with 166 nursing students at a nursing faculty in Turkey. It was a mixed method study using qualitative and quantitative methods. Methods and Variables To capture the picture in a human mind of the complexity of feelings for cancer, writing a description and elicitation interviews were employed. Moreover, to reach ontological and epistemological level thoughts in the deepest layers of elicited metaphors, the data were analyzed in an analytical framework. Results The study provides a conceptualization of ""Cancer."" The students produced 92 valid metaphors. The most commonly used metaphors were found to be ‘death\', ‘war\', ‘a virus\', ‘a malady\' and ‘a spider\'. It was found that the metaphors produced by the students on the concept of cancer generally used negative themes. Implications for Nursing This study provides a framework for understanding all aspects of the concept of cancer on the metaphor axis. It is believed that the results will provide an holistic approach toward the concept of cancer, especially in nursing education, and will increase awareness of this concept.']","['Usta Yeşilbalkan, Öznur, [Kankaya, Hülya], [Karaman, Emine], [Çinar, Derya]']",['10.1007/s10943-021-01275-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01275-w'],[''],['Eliciting the Concept of Cancer in Nursing Students in Turkey: an Exploratory Metaphor Analysis']
"['Formative assessment practices for secondary mathematics have been advocated as valuable for students, but difficult for teachers to learn. There have been calls in the literature to increase the emphasis on formative assessment in mathematics teacher preparation courses. This study explored the use of peer-assessment strategies for helping pre-service secondary mathematics teachers (PSTs) cultivate formative assessment principles and practices for assessing school students. Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of: sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments. We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in Practice to characterize the PSTs’ perceptions of their experience of formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students, in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on average less confidence in assessing school student task responses themselves than in assessing peer work.

"['Abstract The extent to which host group size affects the hosts’ exposure to parasites and pathogens has been explored by behavioral ecologists for almost 50\xa0years, and we know that host and parasite taxa, mobility of host and parasite, and the extent of spatial structure within groups all affect the group-size relationship. Here we examine how the prevalence of an arthropod-borne viral pathogen changes with host group size in a host-parasite system recently invaded by an introduced species that also serves as a host for the virus. Infection by the alphavirus, Buggy Creek virus (BCRV), in swallow bugs ( Cimex vicarius ) increased with colony size of the cliff swallow ( Petrochelidon pyrrhonota ; the bugs’ principal host) in the absence of invasive house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) but decreased with swallow colony size in the presence of sparrows. The sparrow-adapted lineage A of BCRV declined to near extinction in the largest cliff swallow colonies, regardless of sparrow presence. The results may reflect BCRV’s divergence into a lineage (B) that amplifies mostly in bugs and thus is transmitted more effectively in large cliff swallow colonies that maintain high numbers of the blood-feeding bugs, whereas the other lineage (A) is adapted to house sparrows and does not require large numbers of bugs and cliff swallows for effective transmission and persistence. The results show that an alternative host can modify the group-size consequences for the original host and illustrate another complexity in analyzing the costs and benefits of coloniality whenever invasive species are present. Significance statement Predicting the spread of viral pathogens can be important in assessing threats to wildlife or humans, and the size of a host’s social group is regarded as a potentially important determinant of pathogen exposure. Invasive species can sometimes profoundly alter disease dynamics when they enter a host-parasite system and serve as alternative hosts, thereby either increasing or decreasing the original host’s exposure to pathogens. For an arthropod-borne virus that is vectored by a blood-feeding bug that parasitizes a colonially breeding bird, we found that virus infection in bugs increased with host (bird) group size when an invasive bird species was absent but decreased with host group size when the invasive was present. The study indicates that the presence of alternative hosts is another variable to consider in trying to predict how pathogen exposure is affected by host group size.']","['Moore, Amy T., [O’Brien, Valerie A.], [Brown, Charles R.]']",['10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],[''],['Group-size effects on virus prevalence depend on the presence of an invasive species']
"['Orexin (hypocretin), is a neuropeptide produced by a subset of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. From the lateral hypothalamus, the orexin-containing neurons project their fibres extensively to other brain structures, and the spinal cord constituting the central orexinergic system. Generally, the term ‘’orexinergic system’’ usually refers to the orexin peptides and their receptors, as well as to the orexin neurons and their projections to different parts of the central nervous system. The extensive networks of orexin axonal fibres and their terminals allow these neuropeptidergic neurons to exert great influence on their target regions. The hypothalamic neurons containing the orexin neuropeptides have been implicated in diverse functions, especially related to the control of a variety of homeostatic functions including feeding behaviour, arousal, wakefulness stability and energy expenditure. The broad range of functions regulated by the orexinergic system has led to its description as ‘’physiological integrator’’. In the last two decades, the orexinergic system has been a topic of great interest to the scientific community with many reports in the public domain. From the documentations, variations exist in the neuroanatomical profile of the orexinergic neuron soma, fibres and their receptors from animal to animal. Hence, this review highlights the distinct variabilities in the morphophysiological aspects of the orexinergic system in the vertebrate animals, mammals and non-mammals, its presence in other brain-related structures, including its involvement in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. The presence of the neuropeptide in the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral tissues, as well as its alteration in different animal models and conditions are also reviewed.']","['Azeez, Idris A., [Igado, Olumayowa O.], [Olopade, James O.]']",['10.1007/s11011-021-00761-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11011-021-00761-0'],[''],['An overview of the orexinergic system in different animal species']

The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

Blood was collected from wild northern cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) in College Station, Texas, and screened for the presence of Haemoproteus spp. parasites using microscopic and molecular methods. Experimental groups of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were offered Haemoproteus -positive cardinal blood through an artificial feeding apparatus, while control groups received Haemoproteus -negative cardinal blood or domestic canary ( Serinus canaria domestica ) blood. Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes exposed to Haemoproteus infected cardinal blood survived significantly fewer days than mosquitoes that ingested Haemoproteus -negative cardinal blood.

Additionally, mosquitoes that fed on canary controls survived significantly fewer days than cardinal negative controls, with canary control mosquitoes having a median survival time of 17\xa0days. This study further supports prior observations that Haemoproteus parasites can be pathogenic to bird-biting mosquitoes, and suggests that Haemoproteus parasites may indirectly suppress the transmission of co-circulating vector-borne pathogens by modulating vector survivorship.

Perceived risks, benefits, and the perception of the technology as tampering with nature were surveyed and were complemented with socio-demographics and a measure of the participants’ moral foundations. In all countries, participants evaluated the application of disease resistance in humans as most right to do, followed by disease resistance in plants, and then in animals, and considered changes in product quality and quantity in cattle as least right to do. However, US and Italian participants were generally more positive toward all scenarios, and German and Austrian participants more negative. Cluster analyses identified four groups of participants: ‘ strong supporters’ who saw only benefits and little risks, ‘ slight supporters’ who perceived risks and valued benefits, ‘ neutrals’ who showed no pronounced opinion, and ‘ opponents’ who perceived higher risks and lower benefits. This research contributes to understanding public response to applications of genome editing, revealing differences that can help guide decisions related to adoption of these technologies.']","['Busch, Gesa, [Ryan, Erin], [Keyserlingk, Marina A.

"['High infection risk is often associated with aggregations of animals around attractive resources. Here, we explore the behavior of potential hosts of non-trophically transmitted parasites at mesocarnivore carcass sites. We used videos recorded by camera traps at 56 red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) carcasses and 10 carcasses of other wild carnivore species in three areas of southeastern Spain. Scavenging species, especially wild canids, mustelids and viverrids, showed more frequent rubbing behavior at carcass sites than non-scavenging and domestic species, suggesting that they could be exposed to a higher potential infection risk. The red fox was the species that most frequently contacted carcasses and marked and rubbed carcass sites. Foxes contacted heterospecific carcasses more frequently and earlier than conspecific ones and, when close contact occurred, it was more likely to be observed at heterospecific carcasses. This suggests that foxes avoid contact with the type of carcass and time period that have the greatest risk as a source of parasites. Overall, non-trophic behaviors of higher infection risk were mainly associated with visitor-carcass contact and visitor contact with feces and urine, rather than direct contact between visitors. Moreover, contact events between scavengers and carnivore carcasses were far more frequent than consumption events, which suggests that scavenger behavior is more constrained by the risk of acquiring meat-borne parasites than non-trophically transmitted parasites. This study contributes to filling key gaps in understanding the role of carrion in the landscape of disgust, which may be especially relevant in the current global context of emerging and re-emerging pathogens.

"['In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape.']","['Conte, Christine E., [Leahy, Jessica E.], [Gardner, Allison M.]']",['10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],[''],['Active Forest Management Reduces Blacklegged Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Exposure Risk']

However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The microscope slides mostly showed piriform and oval merozoites measuring greater than 2.5\xa0µm in length, which were compatible with B. vogeli . However, smaller forms were also identified, thus demonstrating the polymorphic nature of this parasite.

Methods In this field study, households with flea- or tick-infested dog(s) were enrolled on Day 0 into the study to provide data for either the tick or flea infestation cohorts. Households were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the combination investigational product (IP, Credelio Plus ® tablets) or the control product (CP: Nexgard Spectra ® tablets). Dogs were administered IP (flea cohort n \u2009=\u2009135; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u2009147) or CP (flea cohort: n \u2009=\u200967; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u200974) once every 4 weeks for a total of three times at a dose rate of 20.0–41.5\xa0mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner and 0.75–1.53\xa0mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime (IP) or as recommended (CP). Percentage reduction was calculated by comparing individual dog flea and tick counts at each assessed post-treatment time point to their respective baseline (pre-treatment) infestation. Resolution of the clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) was assessed in flea-allergic dogs on the days that flea counts were performed. Results Flea effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® after 3 consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against Ctenocephalides felis , C. canis and Pulex irritans . Tick effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® over the same time frame was 99.3% for Ixodes ricinus and 100% against Rhipicephalus sanguineus ( s.l. ). Flea effectiveness of the CP after three consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against C. felis , C. canis and P. irritans .

"['If a trademark (“mark”) becomes a generic term, it may be cancelled under trademark law, a process known as genericide. Typically, in genericide cases, consumer surveys are brought into evidence to establish a mark’s semantic status as generic or distinctive. Some drawbacks of surveys are cost, delay, small sample size, lack of reproducibility, and observer bias. Today, however, much discourse involving marks is online. As a potential complement to consumer surveys, therefore, we explore an artificial intelligence approach based chiefly on word embeddings: mathematical models of meaning based on distributional semantics that can be trained on texts selected for jurisdictional and temporal relevance. After identifying two main factors in mark genericness, we first offer a simple screening metric based on the ngram frequency of uncapitalized variants of a mark. We then add two word embedding metrics: one addressing contextual similarity of uncapitalized variants, and one comparing the neighborhood density of marks and known generic terms in a category. For clarity and validation, we illustrate our metrics with examples of genericized, somewhat generic, and distinctive marks such as, respectively, DUMPSTER, DOBRO, and ROLEX.']","['Shackell, Cameron, [De Vine, Lance]']",['10.1007/s10506-021-09291-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10506-021-09291-7'],[''],['Quantifying the genericness of trademarks using natural language processing: an introduction with suggested metrics']
"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Animals from the bloodline born between 1962 and 2019 were considered. A total number of 1722 animals were found to be from the line which represents the entire population (WP), including the basic population (BP) and the reference population (RP) defined as the animals currently living. A total of 982 animals were in the RP, with the oldest living dogs born in 2004. A total of 854 dogs were inbred. The average inbreeding coefficient (F) in the RP was 5.1%, while the average inbreeding of the inbred animals was 5.8%. The F was\u2009<\u20090.10 in 711 dogs (77.3% of inbred), and\u2009>\u20090.20 in only 36 dogs (3.91% of inbred). Fifteen traced generations were highlighted. A maximum average inbreeding value (6.45%) was observed in the dogs with 11 traced generations. This research highlighted the good genetic variability of this Australian Cattle Dog bloodline thanks to the efficient management of the breeders who in the past introduced some stallions from abroad. Currently, the lines in Italy are not sufficiently high to prevent inbreeding in the new matings, which is becoming frequent. It is, therefore, important to continue to import new stallions for reproduction to expand the genetic variability. However, at the same time, the old lines need to be preserved genetically, aptitudinally and morphologically, as they are an important heritage of the breed in Italy.""]","['Ciccarelli, Jacopo, [Macchioni, Fabio], [Cecchi, Francesca]']",['10.1007/s12210-021-00993-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-021-00993-3'],[''],['A genealogical survey on the main bloodline of the Australian Cattle Dog in Italy']

"['Purpose of Review In this review, we report on the state of knowledge about human Q fever in Brazil and on the Guiana Shield, an Amazonian region located in northeastern South America. There is a contrast between French Guiana, where the incidence of this disease is the highest in the world, and other countries where this disease is practically non-existent. Recent Findings Recent findings are essentially in French Guiana where a unique strain MST17 has been identified; it is probably more virulent than those usually found with a particularly marked pulmonary tropism, a mysterious animal reservoir, a geographical distribution that raises questions. Summary Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii that has been reported worldwide. On the Guiana Shield, a region mostly covered by Amazonian forest, which encompasses the Venezuelan State of Bolivar, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian State of Amapá, the situation is very heterogeneous. While French Guiana is the region reporting the highest incidence of this disease in the world, with a single infecting clone (MST 117) and a unique epidemiological cycle, it has hardly ever been reported in other countries in the region. This absence of cases raises many questions and is probably due to massive under-diagnosis. Studies should estimate comprehensively the true burden of this disease in the region.']","['Epelboin, Loïc, [Eldin, Carole], [Thill, Pauline], [Santi, Vincent Pommier], [Abboud, Philippe], [Walter, Gaëlle], [Melzani, Alessia], [Letertre-Gibert, Paule], [Perez, Lucas], [Demar, Magalie], [Boutrou, Mathilde], [Fernandes, Jorlan], [Cermeño, Julman Rosiris], [Panizo, Maria Mercedes], [Vreden, Stephen GS], [Djossou, Félix], [Beillard, Emmanuel], [Waard, Jacobus H.], [Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00243-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00243-4'],[''],['Human Q Fever on the Guiana Shield and Brazil: Recent Findings and Remaining Questions']

"['Recent studies directing attention to how people perceive and define politics have provided valuable contributions to our knowledge of what people do and do not think of as politics. Taken together, the results suggest that individuals’ conceptualisations of politics tend to vary. Considerably less is known, however, about how conceptualisations are related to behaviour. This study aims to fill that gap, by testing the hypothesis that those with a wider conception of what constitutes politics are also more likely to participate in political activities. Drawing on data from a survey administered to students at a Swedish University, the key result shows a clear and positive correlation between conceptualisations of politics and political participation, suggesting that the more issues that people perceive as politics, the more likely it is that they are involved in varieties of political participation. Furthermore, the relationship was still present during analyses including other well-known predictors of participation. This indicates that conceptualisations of politics seem to capture variation in individual political participation better than traditional predictors such as political interest, internal political efficacy, and political awareness. It further suggests that perceptions of politics constitute a distinct political orientation, above and beyond these well-known important factors for understanding political participation. Overall, these results are a first indication that future studies of political participation should not neglect. We therefore suggest that the field of political participation should incorporate indicators of both conceptualisations of politics and political participation.']","['Görtz, Carl, [Dahl, Viktor]']",['10.1057/s41304-019-00240-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41304-019-00240-2'],[''],['Perceptions of politics and their implications: exploring the link between conceptualisations of politics and political participation']
"['As the 1951 Refugee Convention advances into its 70 th anniversary, there are mixed feelings as to whether it has lived up to its aspiration. For while it may be hailed as a significant force in the human rights arena (broadly construed), its narrow focus excludes millions who are constantly subjected to various forms of atrocities at the hands of their governments or third parties. Two major concerns to potential asylum seekers, refugee activists and human rights scholars have been the Convention’s conceptualisation of ‘refugee’ and its status determination processes. This duality is demonstrated in the exclusion of ‘disability’ from the international definition of ‘refugee’ and, more specifically, elimination of ‘albinism’ as a humanitarian imperative. Since children with albinism (CwA) are victims of or face constant threats of persecution and there is limited domestic safeguard, the paper argues that the UN Refugee Agency must partner with western countries in resettling these children and similarly situated persons. The focus on CwA is informed by their limited physical strength to ward off their attackers, thereby making them more vulnerable to abduction and related atrocities. By drawing from the USA’ ‘Lost Boys of Sudan’ narrative, the paper concludes that parties to the UN Refugee Convention should introspect on the humanitarian obligation and assist with the evacuation of these endangered children to overcome their current plight.']","['Nkrumah, Bright']",['10.1007/s12134-020-00773-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12134-020-00773-2'],[''],['Anywhere but Here: a Calculus for Protection of Children with Albinism']
"['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites (Arthropoda: Acari) is reviewed within a mechanical model. Trophic access (body size and cheliceral reach) and food morsel handling (chelal gape and estimated static adductive crushing force) are morphologically investigated. Forty-seven commonly occurring astigmatid mite species from 20 genera (covering the Acaridae, Aeroglyphidae, Carpoglyphidae, Chortoglyphidae, Glycyphagidae, Lardoglyphidae, Pyroglyphidae, Suidasiidae, and Winterschmidtiidae) are categorised into functional groups using heuristics. Conclusions are confirmed with statistical tests and multivariate morphometrics. Despite these saprophagous acarines in general being simple ‘shrunken/swollen’ versions of each other, clear statistical correlations in the specifics of their mechanical design (cheliceral and chelal scale and general shape) with the type of habitat and food consumed (their ‘biome’) are found. Using multivariate analyses, macro- and microsaprophagous subtypes are delineated. Relative ratios of sizes on their own are not highly informative of adaptive syndromes. Sympatric resource competition is examined. Evidence for a maximum doubling of approximate body volume within nominal taxa is detected but larger mites are not more ‘generalist’ feeding types. Two contrasting types of basic ‘Bauplan’ are found differing in general scale: (i) a large, chunk-crunching, ‘demolition’-feeding omnivore design (comprising 10 macrosaprophagous astigmatid species), and (ii) a small selective picking, squashing/slicing or fragmentary/‘plankton’ feeding design (which may indicate obligate fungivory/microbivory) comprising 20 microsaprophagous acarid-shaped species. Seventeen other species appear to be specialists. Eleven of these are either: small (interstitial/burrowing) omnivores—or a derived form designed for processing large hard food morsels (debris durophagy, typified by the pyroglyphid Dermatophagoides farinae ), or a specialist sub-type of particular surface gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeding. Six possible other minor specialist gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeders types each comprising one to two species are described. Details of these astigmatid trophic-processing functional groups need field validation and more corroborative comparative enzymology. Chelal velocity ratio in itself is not highly predictive of habitat but with cheliceral aspect ratio (or chelal adductive force) is indicative of life-style. Herbivores and pest species are typified by a predicted large chelal adductive force. Pest species may be ‘shredders’ derived from protein-seeking necrophages. Carpoglyphus lactis typifies a mite with tweezer-like chelae of very feeble adductive force. It is suggested that possible zoophagy (hypocarnivory) is associated with low chelal adductive force together with a small or large gape depending upon the size of the nematode being consumed. Kuzinia laevis typifies an oophagous durophage. Functional form is correlated with taxonomic position within the Astigmata—pyroglyphids and glycyphagids being distinct from acarids. A synthesis with mesostigmatid and oribatid feeding types is offered together with clarification of terminologies. The chelal lyrifissure in the daintiest chelicerae of these astigmatids is located similar to where the action of the chelal moveable digit folds the cheliceral shaft in uropodoids, suggesting mechanical similarities of function. Acarid astigmatids are trophically structured like microphytophagous/fragmentary feeding oribatids. Some larger astigmatids ( Aleuroglyphus ovatus , Kuzinia laevis , Tyroborus lini ) approximate, and Neosuidasia sp. matches, the design of macrophytophagous oribatids. Most astigmatid species reviewed appear to be positioned with other oribatid secondary decomposers. Only Dermatophagoides microceras might be a primary decomposer approximating a lichenivorous oribatid ( Austrachipteria sp.) in trophic form. Astigmatid differences are consilient with the morphological trend from micro- to macrophytophagy in oribatids. The key competency in these actinotrichid mites is a type of ‘gnathosomisation’ through increased chelal and cheliceral height (i.e., a shape change that adjusts the chelal input effort arm and input adductive force) unrestricted by the dorsal constraint of a mesostigmatid-like gnathotectum. A predictive nomogram for ecologists to use on field samples is included. Future work is proposed in detail.']","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],[''],['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites']

"['Transmembrane conductance of small uncharged solutes such as glycerol typically occurs through aquaglyceroporins (Glps), which are commonly encoded by multiple genes in metazoan organisms. To date, however, little is known concerning the evolution of Glps in Crustacea or what forces might underly such apparent gene redundancy. Here, we show that Glp evolution in Crustacea is highly divergent, ranging from single copy genes in species of pedunculate barnacles, tadpole shrimps, isopods, amphipods and decapods to up to 10 copies in diplostracan water fleas although with monophyletic origins in each lineage. By contrast the evolution of Glps in Copepoda appears to be polyphyletic, with surprisingly high rates of gene duplication occurring in a genera- and species-specific manner. Based upon functional experiments on the Glps from a parasitic copepod ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ), we show that such lineage-level gene duplication and splice variation is coupled with a high rate of neofunctionalization. In the case of L. salmonis , splice variation of a given gene resulted in tissue- or sex-specific expression of the channels, with each variant evolving unique sites for protein kinase C (PKC)- or protein kinase A (PKA)-regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking. The combined data sets thus reveal that mutations favouring a high fidelity control of intracellular trafficking regulation can be a selection force for the evolution and retention of multiple Glps in copepods. Marc Catalán-Garcia et al. examine evolutionary divergence of aquaglyceroporins (GLPs) in copepods, observing that these genes are subject to high rates of gene duplication across species. They also report tissue- and sex-specific expression of GLP splice variants in the parasitic copepod, L. salmonis, that in turn exhibit PKA- or PKC-dependent changes in membrane trafficking. Altogether, these results suggest that mutations in GLP genes with precise regulation of intracellular tracking may be related to neofunctionalization in these species.']","['Catalán-García, Marc, [Chauvigné, François], [Stavang, Jon Anders], [Nilsen, Frank], [Cerdà, Joan], [Finn, Roderick Nigel]']",['10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],[''],['Lineage-level divergence of copepod glycerol transporters and the emergence of isoform-specific trafficking regulation']

Methods In this 11-month field study, 319 dogs\u2009≥\u20098\xa0weeks old confirmed to be heartworm-negative were enrolled from eight geographically distinct US veterinary clinics, including sites in the southern USA and Mississippi River Valley. The dogs were treated with either the IP combination product at 0.75–1.53\xa0mg/kg milbemycin oxime and 20–41.5\xa0mg/kg lotilaner ( n \u2009=\u2009159) or the CP (Sentinel ® Flavor Tabs ® ; milbemycin oxime/lufenuron) at the label-recommended dose rate ( n \u2009=\u2009158.)

Results All dogs treated with the IP combination product and the CP tested negative (100% prevention) for heartworm infection on day 330. The IP combination product tablets containing milbemycin oxime and lotilaner were well tolerated based on the safety assessments in all treated dogs. Conclusions This multi-site clinical study using client-owned dogs demonstrated that monthly use of flavored, chewable tablets containing a combination of milbemycin oxime and lotilaner administered orally under end use conditions is safe for dogs.

"['Developing general principles of host–microorganism interactions necessitates a robust understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes that structure microbiota. Phylosymbiosis, or patterns of microbiome composition that can be predicted by host phylogeny, is a unique framework for interrogating these processes. Identifying the contexts in which phylosymbiosis does and does not occur facilitates an evaluation of the relative importance of different ecological processes in shaping the microbial community. In this Review, we summarize the prevalence of phylosymbiosis across the animal kingdom on the basis of the current literature and explore the microbial community assembly processes and related host traits that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We find that phylosymbiosis is less prevalent in taxonomically richer microbiomes and hypothesize that this pattern is a result of increased stochasticity in the assembly of complex microbial communities. We also note that despite hosting rich microbiomes, mammals commonly exhibit phylosymbiosis. We hypothesize that this pattern is a result of a unique combination of mammalian traits, including viviparous birth, lactation and the co-evolution of haemochorial placentas and the eutherian immune system, which compound to ensure deterministic microbial community assembly. Examining both the individual and the combined importance of these traits in driving phylosymbiosis provides a new framework for research in this area moving forward.

"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

In order to do so, I will borrow from the terminology employed in recent debates in the philosophy of evil which have tackled a similar problem to the one at hand, i.e. defining what sets evil apart from ordinary wrongdoing. Here it has been argued that concepts could be distinct in three ways: they can have a quantitative difference, a strong qualitative or a moderate qualitative difference.

"['Purpose of Review Increasing attention has been paid in recent decades to social determinants of health as a risk factor for disease development and disease severity. While traditionally heart disease, family history, lipid profile, and tobacco use have all been associated with increased risk of neurological disease, numerous studies now show that the influence of poverty may be just as strong a risk factor. This study summarizes the recent literature on poverty as it contributes to neurological disease. Recent Findings Children growing up in poverty have increased risk for cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders as reported by Noble et al. (Dev Sci. 9(6):642–54, 2006) and Farah et al. (Brain Res. 1110(1):166–74, 2006) as well as worse outcomes when it comes to epilepsy management and disease course as discussed by Camfield et al. (Epilepsia. 57(11):1826–33, 2016). In adulthood, as the number of social determinants of health increases, the incidence of stroke and severe stroke increases significantly as reported by Reshetnyak et al. (Stroke. 51:2445–53, 2020) as does exposure to neurologically significant infectious diseases and incidence of dementia as reported by Sumilo et al.

Summary Social determinants of health including poverty should be considered a risk factor for disease.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"
"['In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country.

"[""A model based upon mechanics is used in a re-analysis of historical acarine morphological work augmented by an extra seven zoophagous mesostigmatid species. This review shows that predatory mesostigmatids do have cheliceral designs with clear rational purposes. Almost invariably within an overall body size class, the switch in predatory style from a worm-like prey feeding (‘crushing/mashing’ kill) functional group to a micro-arthropod feeding (‘active prey cutting/slicing/slashing' kill) functional group is matched by: an increased cheliceral reach, a bigger chelal gape, a larger morphologically estimated chelal crunch force, and a drop in the adductive lever arm velocity ratio of the chela. Small size matters. Several uropodines ( Eviphis ostrinus , the omnivore Trachytes aegrota , Urodiaspis tecta and, Uropoda orbicularis ) have more elongate chelicerae (greater reach) than their chelal gape would suggest, even allowing for allometry across mesostigmatids. They may be: plesiosaur-like high-speed strikers of prey, scavenging carrion feeders (like long-necked vultures), probing/burrowing crevice feeders of cryptic nematodes, or small morsel/fragmentary food feeders. Some uropodoids have chelicerae and chelae which probably work like a construction-site mechanical excavator-digger with its small bucket. Possible hoeing/bulldozing, spore-cracking and tiny sabre-tooth cat-like striking actions are discussed for others. Subtle changes lead small mesostigmatids to be predator–scavengers (mesocarnivores) or to be predator–fungivores (hypocarnivores). Some uropodines (e.g., the worm-like prey feeder Alliphis siculus and, Uropoda orbicularis ) show chelae similar in design to astigmatids and cryptostigmatids indicating possible facultative saprophagy. Scale matters—obligate predatory designs (hypercarnivory) start for mesostigmatids with chelal gape > 150 μm and cheliceral reach > 350 μm (i.e., about 500–650 μm in body size). Commonality of trophic design in these larger species with solifugids is indicated. Veigaia species with low chelal velocity ratio and other morphological strengthening specialisms, appear specially adapted in a concerted way for predating active soft and fast moving springtails (Collembola). Veigaia cerva shows a markedly bigger chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would proportionately infer suggesting it is a crocodile-like sit-and-wait or ambush predator par excellence . A small chelal gape, low cheliceral reach, moderate velocity ratio variant of the worm-like feeding habit design is supported for phytoseiid pollenophagy. Evidence for a resource partitioning model in the evolution of gnathosomal development is found. A comparison to crustacean claws and vertebrate mandibles is made. Alliphis siculus and Rhodacarus strenzkei are surprisingly powerful mega-cephalics for their small size. Parasitids show a canid-like trophic design. The chelicera of the nematophagous Alliphis halleri shows felid-like features. Glyphtholaspis confusa has hyaena-like cheliceral dentition. The latter species has a markedly smaller chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would suggest proportionately, which together with a high chelal velocity ratio and a high estimated chelal crunch force matches a power specialism of feeding on immobile tough fly eggs/pupae by crushing (durophagy). A consideration of gnathosomal orientation is made. Predatory specialisms appear to often match genera especially in larger mesostigmatids, which may scale quite differently. Comparison to holothyrids and opilioacarids indicates that the cheliceral chelae of the former are cutting-style and those of the latter are crushing-style. A simple validated easy-to-use ‘2:1 on’ predictive algorithm of feeding habit type is included based on a strength-speed tradeoff in chelal velocity ratio for ecologists to test in the field.""]","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],[''],['Feeding design in free-living mesostigmatid chelicerae (Acari: Anactinotrichida)']

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

"['The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae , is a significant ectoparasite of penguins in Antarctica and of other seabirds, mainly in coastal, polar regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but the tick’s distribution extends into more temperate regions as well. The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built.

Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s).

Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens.

"['Nile tilapia is an important economically farmed fish worldwide, and Streptococcus agalactiae has become the most serious disease problem for the tilapia industry in China. Therefore, a better understanding of the innate immune mechanisms and their functions in the context of pathogen invasion is needed. In this study, a high-throughput proteomic strategy was developed for determining the differential expression proteins (DEPs) of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) (susceptible and resistant GIFT species) splenic responses to S. agalactiae infection. The results showed 1608 proteins were identified with high confidence ( P < 0.05). A total of 441 and 382 DEPs were characterized in susceptible and resistant GIFT tilapia species, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) annotation showed that the DEPs covered many biological functions, including cellular process, metabolism, and immune process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly enriched in the lysosome, apoptosis, and complement and coagulation cascade pathways during S. agalactiae infection. By group comparisons, the proteins related to immune response, cytoskeleton, and energy metabolism of disease-resistant strains were upregulated compared with those of susceptible strain. The content determination of immune-related enzyme activity was consistent with the results obtained throughout the study. More active innate immune system and cell defense is the basis of S. agalactiae resistance for disease-resistant GIFT tilapia species. Furthermore, 34 proteins involved in disease resistance were characterized. Therefore, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the immune system and defense mechanisms of GIFT tilapia in response to S. agalactiae infection and provides valuable recommendations for breeding disease-resistant GIFT tilapia species.']","['Zhu, Jiajie, [Yu, Kai], [Ao, Qiuwei], [Tan, Yun], [Fu, Qiang], [Jiang, Hesheng]']",['10.1007/s10499-021-00683-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00683-9'],[''],['Comparative splenic proteomic analysis of susceptible and resistant GIFT tilapia following challenge with Streptococcus agalactiae']
"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background Theileria orientalis is a tick-borne hemoparasite that causes anemia, ill thrift, and death in cattle globally. The Ikeda strain of T. orientalis is more virulent than other strains, leading to severe clinical signs and death of up to 5% of affected animals. Within the Asia–Pacific region, where it affects 25% of Australian cattle, T. orientalis Ikeda has a significant economic impact on the cattle industry. In 2017, T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in a cattle herd in Albermarle County, Virginia, United States. Months earlier, the U.S. was alerted to the invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, throughout the eastern U.S. Abundant H. longicornis ticks were identified on cattle in the T. orientalis- affected herd in VA, and a subset of ticks from the environment were PCR-positive for T. orientalis Ikeda. A strain of T. orientalis from a previous U.S. outbreak was not transmissible by H. longicornis ; however, H. longicornis is the primary tick vector of T. orientalis Ikeda in other regions of the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether invasive H. longicornis ticks in the U.S. are competent vectors of T. orientalis Ikeda. Methods Nymphal H. longicornis ticks were fed on a splenectomized calf infected with the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. After molting, a subset of adult ticks from this cohort were dissected, and salivary glands assayed for T. orientalis Ikeda via qPCR. The remaining adult ticks from the group were allowed to feed on three calves. Calves were subsequently monitored for T. orientalis Ikeda infection via blood smear cytology and PCR. Results After acquisition feeding on a VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda-infected calf as nymphs, a subset of molted adult tick salivary glands tested positive by qPCR for T. orientalis Ikeda. Adult ticks from the same cohort successfully transmitted T. orientalis Ikeda to 3/3 naïve calves, each of which developed parasitemia reaching 0.4–0.9%. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that U.S. H. longicornis ticks are competent vectors of the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. This data provides important information for the U.S. cattle industry regarding the potential spread of this parasite and the necessity of enhanced surveillance and control measures.']","['Dinkel, Kelcey D., [Herndon, David R.], [Noh, Susan M.], [Lahmers, Kevin K.], [Todd, S.

"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']

Seven tick species are known to feed on bare-nosed wombats ( Vombatus ursinus ), in addition to the highly prevalent Sarcoptes scabiei mite which causes fatal sarcoptic mange in most bare-nosed wombat populations. Little is known about the pathogens carried by most wombat ticks or how they may impact wombats and wombat handlers. Methods Wombat ticks were sourced from wildlife hospitals and sanctuaries across Australia and identified to species level using taxonomic keys. Genomic DNA was extracted from a subsample, and following the amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3–V4 hypervariable region, next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform was used to assess the microbial composition. Results A total of 447 tick specimens were collected from 47 bare-nosed wombats between January 2019 and January 2020. Five species of ticks were identified comprising wombat tick Bothriocroton auruginans ( n = 420), wallaby tick Haemaphysalis bancrofti ( n = 8), bush tick Haemaphysalis longicornis ( n = 3), common marsupial tick Ixodes tasmani ( n = 12), and Australian paralysis tick Ixodes holocyclus ( n = 4). Tick infestations ranged from one to 73 ticks per wombat. The wombat tick was the most prevalent tick species comprising 94% of the total number of samples and was present on 97.9% (46/47) of wombat hosts. NGS results revealed the 16S rRNA gene diversity profile was predominantly Proteobacteria (55.1%) followed by Firmicutes (21.9%) and Actinobacteria (18.4%).

In contrast, in our preliminary survey of the field collected adult lone star ticks, we found the number of culturable/viable bacteria very low. Methods We aimed to analyze the bacterial community of A. americanum by a parallel culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach applied to individual ticks. Results We analyzed 94 adult females collected in eastern Kansas and found that 60.8% of ticks had no culturable bacteria and the remaining ticks carried only 67.7\u2009±\u200942.8 colony-forming units (CFUs)/tick representing 26 genera.

Therefore, a study was carried out to determine the prevalence of ectoparasites of wild game in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria. Physical examinations were carried out on 143 wildlife, and laboratory identification was employed on the ectoparasites. The collected ectoparasites were identified in the laboratory using literature and with the help of a taxonomist. Results Out of the 143 game examined, 114 was infected with at least one parasite representing about 98.6% of an infestation. Among the parasites identified, Amblyomma spp . showed the highest prevalence of 24.5% at 95% confidential intervals of CI (1.45–3.19)–24.5% ( p \u2009≤\u20090.05). No difference was observed in the prevalence of the ectoparasites according to sex, except for Ixodes holocyclus. Similarly, no difference was observed in prevalence with reference to age except for Rhipicephalus spp . and Polyplax spinulosa which showed differences. Conclusions The present study provides basic data about the most prevalent ectoparasitic arthropod among game in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria, which requires an evaluation of its zoonotic control measures. This work can elicit the risk of possible transmission of some zoonotic and enzootic diseases via game. Improving awareness among local people and bushmeat dealers about the risk of contracting a vector-borne disease through wildlife is crucial.']","['Ozioko, Kingsley Uchenna, [Okoye, Chris Ikem], [Ubachukwu, Patience Obiageli], [Agbu, Raymond Awudu], [Ezewudo, Bede Izuchukwu], [Ezea, Celestine Osita]']",['10.1186/s42269-020-00461-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42269-020-00461-2'],[''],"['Prevalence assessment of ectoparasitic arthropods among commonly consumed wildlife in Nsukka, southeast Nigeria']"
"['Ticks are well known as vectors of many viruses which usually do great harm to human and animal health. Yunnan Province, widely covered by flourishing vegetation and mainly relying on farming husbandry, is abundant with Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the viral profile present in R. microplus parasitizing on cattle in Yunnan Province. In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan. These viruses consist of single-stranded, circular and segmented sense RNAs, showing a greatly diversity in genomic organization. Furthermore, continuous epidemiological survey among ticks reveals broad prevalence of three viruses (Yunnan mivirus 1, Wuhan tick vrius 1 and YN tick-associated phlebovirus 1) and two possible prevalent viruses including a flavivirus-like segmented virus (Jingmen tick virus) and a bovine hokovirus 2 in Yunnan. Serological investigation among cattle indicates that these identified viruses may be infectious to cattle and can elicit corresponding antibody. Our findings on R. microplus -associated viral community will contribute to the prevention of viral disease and tracking the viral evolution. Further analysis is needed to better elucidate the pathogenicity and natural circulation of these viruses.']","['Shi, Junming, [Shen, Shu], [Wu, Hui], [Zhang, Yunzhi], [Deng, Fei]']",['10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x'],[''],"['Metagenomic Profiling of Viruses Associated with Rhipicephalus microplus Ticks in Yunnan Province, China']"
"['Rickettsia is an infectious disease, caused by a small obligate intracellular gram-negative bacillus, which is transmitted to humans by blood-borne arthropods such as ticks, lice, mites, and fleas. It has a worldwide distribution, as an emerging and re-emerging febrile illness, accompanied by rash and eschar; its diagnosis is difficult, since its confirmation is made after the acute febrile episode, through serological tests. The suspicion of this infection should be high, since timely antibiotic treatment can lead to rapid clinical improvement. It is a life-threatening infection, with pulmonary manifestations, acute kidney injury, gangrene, and neurological manifestations such as delirium, seizures, stupor, and coma. During pregnancy, this infection can cause maternal mortality, with a high frequency of complications such as stillbirth, prematurity, and low birth weight. The use of the tetracyclines group, specifically doxycycline, is preferred as the first line, due to its efficacy and low toxicity to the mother as well as child, the use of quinolones remaining in the second line.

"['Cloth-dragging is the most widely-used method for collecting and counting ticks, but there are few studies of its reliability. By using cloth-dragging, we applied a replicated line transects survey method, in two areas in Sweden with different Ixodes ricinus tick-densities (low at Grimsö and high at Bogesund) to evaluate developmental stage specific repeatability, agreement and precision in estimates of tick abundance. ‘Repeatability’ was expressed as the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), ‘agreement’ with the Total Deviation Index (TDI) and ‘precision’ by the coefficient of variation (CV) for a given dragging distance. Repeatability (ICC) and agreement (TDI) were higher for the most abundant instar (nymphs) and in the area of higher abundance. At Bogesund tick counts were higher than at Grimsö and so also repeatability, with fair to substantial ICC estimates between 0.22 and 0.75, and TDI ranged between 1 and 44.5 counts of difference (thus high to moderate agreement). At Grimsö, ICC was poor to moderate and ranged between 0 and 0.59, whereas TDI remained low with estimates lower or equal to 1 count (thus high agreement). Despite a 100-fold lower abundance at Grimsö, the same level of precision for nymphs could be achieved with a 70% increase of dragging effort.

We studied the cross-sectional associations of two glucose variability indices (CGM-assessed SD [SD CGM ] and CGM-assessed CV [CV CGM ]) and time in range (TIR CGM ) with carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid distensibility coefficient, carotid intima–media thickness, ankle–brachial index and circumferential wall stress via multiple linear regression. Results Higher SD CGM was associated with higher cf-PWV after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle factors (regression coefficient [B] per 1\xa0mmol/l SD CGM [and corresponding 95% CI]: 0.413\xa0m/s [0.147, 0.679], p \u2009=\u20090.002). In the model additionally adjusted for CGM-assessed mean sensor glucose (MSG CGM ), SD CGM and MSG CGM contributed similarly to cf-PWV (respective standardised regression coefficients [st.βs] and 95% CIs of 0.065 [−0.018, 0.167], p \u2009=\u20090.160; and 0.059 [−0.043, 0.164], p \u2009=\u20090.272). In the fully adjusted models, both higher CV CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% CV CGM : 0.303\xa0m/s [0.046, 0.559], p \u2009=\u20090.021) and lower TIR CGM (B [95% CI] per 10% TIR CGM : −0.145\xa0m/s [−0.252, −0.038] p \u2009=\u20090.008) were statistically significantly associated with higher cf-PWV. Such consistent associations were not observed for the other arterial measures. Conclusions Our findings show that greater daily glucose variability and lower TIR CGM are associated with greater aortic stiffness (cf-PWV) but not with other arterial measures. If corroborated in prospective studies, these results support the development of therapeutic agents that target both daily glucose variability and TIR CGM to prevent CVD.

Interspecific mating can lead to reproductive interference, where wasted time, energy, nutrients, or gametes reduces the fitness of one or both of the interacting species. However, the ecological and evolutionary forces that maintain this seemingly maladaptive behavior remain poorly understood, in part because the natural complexity of heterospecific encounters is often not considered experimentally. The goal of this study was to directly test if the negative effects of heterospecific mating can be mitigated by conspecific mating. We used two closely related species of squash bug, Anasa tristis and Anasa andresii, which are known to readily mate with each other despite clear negative fitness consequences. We gave all females opportunities to mate with conspecific males before and after encountering heterospecific males. We found that A. tristis females can alleviate temporary bouts of heterospecific interference when given opportunities to mate with conspecifics. However, we found the opposite for A. andresii females. Mating with conspecifics did not shelter female A. andresii from the consequences of heterospecific mating. Our study reveals the complex dynamics of reproductive interference and highlights scenarios where mating with the wrong species can have either minimal or long-lasting effects on fitness. We emphasize the benefit of assessing reproductive interference using experiments that not only vary heterospecific encounter rates, but that also quantify lifetime measures of fitness. Our study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the importance of reproductive interference and sheds light on why this seemingly paradoxical behavior continues to persist.']","['Villa, Scott M., [Han, Diane D.], [Jordan, Malichai E.], [Gerardo, Nicole M.]']",['10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10120-1'],[''],['The resilience of reproductive interference']

The meta-analysis involved 23 studies assessing cross-informant agreement for preschool children. Informants were parents and teachers. The level of cross-informant agreement tended to be low.

Among\u2009+\u200965 aged population, we studied 22 (mean age: 71.4\u2009±\u20094.5\xa0years) patients and 47 controls (mean age: 70.9\u2009±\u20094.8\xa0years). All study subjects had a negative history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21\xa0days following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers were measured quantitatively using a commercially available immunoassay method. Results Patients with IMD were significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7% vs 99.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and elderly population (77.3% vs 97.9%, p \u2009=\u20090.011).

"['Objectives Although there are promising studies on cancer treatment, it is still a frightening disease. For effective treatment, an integrative and positive perspective is required. Using the power of metaphors to facilitate understanding of complex and intangible ideas, this study aims to define cancer from the perspective of Turkish nursing students. Sample and Setting This study was conducted with 166 nursing students at a nursing faculty in Turkey. It was a mixed method study using qualitative and quantitative methods. Methods and Variables To capture the picture in a human mind of the complexity of feelings for cancer, writing a description and elicitation interviews were employed. Moreover, to reach ontological and epistemological level thoughts in the deepest layers of elicited metaphors, the data were analyzed in an analytical framework. Results The study provides a conceptualization of ""Cancer."" The students produced 92 valid metaphors. The most commonly used metaphors were found to be ‘death\', ‘war\', ‘a virus\', ‘a malady\' and ‘a spider\'. It was found that the metaphors produced by the students on the concept of cancer generally used negative themes.

"['Purpose Choir singing is an important tradition of Christian worship across India. However, vocal health issues related to the church choir singers are less addressed in the literature. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vocal symptoms, identify the variables associated with increased risk of voice problems and knowledge of factors influencing vocal health in church choir singers. Method One hundred and forty-eight church choir singers (61 males and 85 females) between the age range of 18 and 70\xa0years participated in the study. They completed a self-reported questionnaire addressing demographic and singing-related details, vocal symptoms, variables associated with increased risk reporting voice problems and knowledge about factors influencing vocal health. Result Eighty-four percent of the choir singers reported two or more vocal symptoms sometimes or more frequently while or after singing. More than half of the church choir singers had experienced vocal symptoms such as accessing notes in the upper range, loss of vocal endurance, pitch breaks, hoarseness, dryness in the throat, and discomfort in the throat. Among the different variables, systemic hydration found to have a significant association with reporting of voice problems in church choir singers. The overall knowledge regarding the factors influencing vocal health was found to be limited among the choir singers. Conclusion Choir singers like other professional singers experienced a higher prevalence of vocal symptoms during or after singing and exhibited limited knowledge about factors that negatively influence vocal health.

Experiments are performed over four publicly available databases, i.e., MSR Daily Activity 3D Dataset, UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset, KARD- Kinect Activity Recognition Dataset, and SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset, and proved that proposed descriptor outperforms as a comparison to state-of-the-art approaches on entire four datasets.

"[""South Africa maintains the world’s largest HIV prevalence, accounting for 20.4% of people living with HIV internationally. HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers’ (HCWs)’ beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that\xa0minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs’ role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions. Inviting leadership from local HCWs may increase the likelihood of delivery plans that account for unique local context and structural barriers researchers may otherwise struggle to uncover.""]","['Asabor, Emmanuella Ngozi, [Lett, Elle], [Moll, Anthony], [Shenoi, Sheela V.]']",['10.1007/s10461-021-03213-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03213-z'],[''],"[""“We’ve Got Our Own Beliefs, Attitudes, Myths”: A Mixed Methods Assessment of Rural South African Health Care Workers' Knowledge of\xa0and Attitudes Towards PrEP Implementation""]"

"['Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a virus called “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).” In the majority of patients, infection with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or may cause only mild symptoms. However, in some patients, there can also be immunological problems, such as macrophage activation syndrome (CSS) that results in cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Comprehension of host-microbe communications is the critical aspect in the advancement of new therapeutics against infectious illnesses. Endogenous animal lectins, a class of proteins, may perceive non-self glycans found on microorganisms. Serum mannose-binding lectin (sMBL), as a part of the innate immune framework, recognizes a wide range of microbial microorganisms and activates complement cascade via an antibody-independent pathway. Although the molecular basis for the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not generally understood, scientific literature indicates that COVID-19 is correlated with unregulated activation of the complement in terms of disease severity. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), inflammation, and immune paralysis contribute to unregulated complement activation. Pre-existing genetic defects in MBL and their association with complement play a major role in immune response dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In order to generate anti-complement-based therapies in Covid-19, an understanding of sMBL in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and complement is therefore essential. This review highlights the role of endogenous sMBL and complement activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their therapeutic management by various agents, mainly plant lectins, since antiviral mannose-binding plant lectins (pMBLs) offer potential applications in the prevention and control of viral infections.']","['Gupta, Anita, [Gupta, G.

"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

Demographic and professional data, experience with qMRI techniques in the brain and head and neck, usage, reasons for/against application, and knowledge of the QIBA and EIBALL initiatives were assessed. Results Two hundred seventy-two responders in 23 countries used the following techniques clinically (mean values in %): DWI (82.0%, n = 223), DSC (67.3%, n = 183), MRS (64.3%, n = 175), DCE (43.4%, n = 118), BOLD-fMRI (42.6%, n = 116), ASL (37.5%, n = 102), fat quantification (25.0%, n = 68), T2 mapping (16.9%, n = 46), T1 mapping (15.1%, n = 41), PET-MRI (11.8%, n = 32), IVIM (5.5%, n = 15), APT-CEST (4.8%, n = 13), and DKI (3.3%, n = 9). The most frequent usage indications for any qMRI technique were tissue differentiation (82.4%, n = 224) and oncological monitoring (72.8%, n = 198). Usage differed between countries, e.g. ASL: Germany ( n = 13/63; 20.6%) vs. France ( n = 31/40; 77.5%). Neuroradiologists endorsed the use of qMRI because of an improved diagnostic accuracy (89.3%, n = 243), but 50.0% ( n = 136) are in need of better technology, 34.9% ( n = 95) wish for more communication, and 31.3% need help with result interpretation/generation ( n = 85).

Beyond the aspect of readiness for clinical use, better availability of support and a wider dissemination of guidelines could catalyse a broader implementation. Key Points • Neuroradiologists endorse the use of qMRI techniques as they subjectively improve diagnostic accuracy. • Clinical implementation is highly variable between countries, techniques, and indications. • The use of advanced imaging could be promoted through an increase in technical support and training of both doctors and technicians.']","['Manfrini, Elia, [Smits, Marion], [Thust, Steffi], [Geiger, Sergej], [Bendella, Zeynep], [Petr, Jan], [Solymosi, Laszlo], [Keil, Vera C.]']",['10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07582-2'],[''],['From research to clinical practice: a European neuroradiological survey on quantitative advanced MRI implementation']

The experimental layout contained an array of 21 flux stations over a 1 km $$^2$$ 2 grid. Sensible heat fluxes show high spatial variability, with maximum variability occurring during convective periods. Maximum variability in the vertical heat flux is 50–80 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 40%), while in the horizontal flux, it is 200–500 W m $$^{-2}$$ - 2 (median variability of 48% for the streamwise and 40% for the spanwise fluxes). Ensemble averages computed during convective afternoon periods show large magnitudes of horizontal advection (48 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 172 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) and vertical flux divergence (13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 or 47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ). Probability density functions of the total derivative from convective cases show mean volumetric heating rates of 43 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 (154 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) compared to 13 W m $$^{-3}$$ - 3 (47 K h $$^{-1}$$ - 1 ) on non-convective days. A conceptual model based on persistent mean flow structures from local-surface-temperature heterogeneities may explain the observed advection. The model describes the difference between locally-driven advection and advection driven by larger-scale forcings. Of the cases examined, 83% with streamwise and 81% with spanwise advection during unstable periods are classified as locally driven by nearby surface thermal heterogeneities.']","['Morrison, Travis, [Calaf, Marc], [Higgins, Chad W.], [Drake, Stephen A.], [Perelet, Alexei], [Pardyjak, Eric]']",['10.1007/s10546-021-00624-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-021-00624-2'],[''],['The Impact of Surface Temperature Heterogeneity on Near-Surface Heat Transport']
"['Evidence-based parenting programs have shown efficacy across a range of contexts, however, the cultural fit of a program can affect program engagement and participation. Ensuring the acceptability of programs and strategies is essential prior to wider dissemination. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to assess the acceptability of Group Triple P with Brazilian parents. A cross-sectional design was used with a sample of convenience ( n \u2009=\u200938 Brazilian parents) who had completed Triple P as a part of another study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from these parents in order to explore their perceptions of the program and its strategies. The quantitative outcomes revealed the participants found the strategies highly acceptable and highly useful and were moderately satisfied with the program. The most common barriers identified by parents to accessing the program were logistical (e.g., access to childcare, and competing work commitments) and emotional (e.g., shame for parents) rather than cultural barriers. A thematic analysis of qualitative responses revealed four major themes: recommendations for program implementation, cultural appropriateness, barriers to implementing Triple P and changes in parenting. Overall, the participants were very positive about Triple P and perceived the program to be consistent with the cultural values of Brazilian parents, however, some recommendations to improve cultural fit were noted. Group Triple P was viewed as acceptable and useful by Brazilian parents. More research examining Triple P in Brazil is warranted. Barriers to access the program were investigated, these appear to be similar to other countries and not unique to Brazil. The results add to the growing evidence suggesting that Triple P is acceptable across cultures.']","['Schulz, Mariajose L.

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']
"['Objectives Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), as a malignancy marker, is overly expressed in multiple solid tumors including colorectal neoplasms, one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. The main objective of this study is to enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy targeting EGFR by constructing a novel EGFR-specific immunotoxin (C-CUS 245C ) based on Cetuximab and recombinant Cucurmosin (CUS 245C ). Methods E. coli BL21 (DE3) PlysS ( E. coli ) was used to express CUS 245C with a cysteine residue inserting to the C-terminus of Cucurmosin. Then immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to purify CUS 245C . The chemical conjugation method was used for the preparation of C-CUS 245C . Then dialysis and IMAC were used to purify C-CUS 245C . Western blot as well as SDS-PAGE was carried out to characterize the formation of C-CUS 245C . At last the anti-colorectal cancer activity of C-CUS 245C was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Results CUS 245C with high purity could be obtained from the prokaryotic system. C-CUS 245C was successfully constructed and highly purified. The cytotoxicity assays in vitro showed a significant proliferation inhibition of C-CUS 245C on EGFR-positive cells for 120 h with IC 50 values less than 0.1 pM. Besides, the anti-tumor efficacy of C-CUS 245C was remarkably more potent than that of Cetuximab, CUS 245C , and C\u2009+\u2009CUS 245C ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). Whereas the cytotoxicity of C-CUS 245C could hardly be detected on EGFR-null cell line. Our results also showed that C-CUS 245C had efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer in mouse xenograft model, indicating the therapeutic potential of C-CUS 245C for the targeted therapy of colorectal neoplasms. Conclusions C-CUS 245C exhibits potent and EGFR-specific cytotoxicity. Insertional mutagenesis technique is worthy to be adopted in the preparation of immunotoxin. Immunotoxin can be highly purified through dialysis followed by IMAC.']","['Wu, Shuifa, [Deng, Cuimin], [Zhang, Caiyun], [Xiong, Jiani], [Gu, Xiaofan], [Wang, Ze], [Tu, Jingjing], [Xie, Jieming]']",['10.1007/s12094-020-02548-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02548-8'],[''],['Preparation of a novel EGFR specific immunotoxin and its efficacy of anti-colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo']
"['Background Most physicians sometimes apply therapies without specific active ingredients. Although patients seem to judge such placebo treatments as acceptable under certain circumstances, deception is still an ethical problem. Open-label placebos (OLPs) might be a promising approach to solve this dilemma. This study compared general acceptance and outcome expectations of OLPs and deceptive placebos (DPs). Methods In an experimental online study, 814 participants read a case vignette of a person with insomnia receiving a pill. The participants were then randomly allocated into two groups, where the second part of the vignette described the pill as either a deceptive placebo (DP group) or as an open-label placebo (OLP group). The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) assessed outcome expectations after the first (pre-assessment) and the second (post-assessment) parts of the vignette. Treatment acceptance was measured at post-assessment. Data from 798 participants were analyzed by a mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), t- tests, and post-hoc mediation analyses. Results The MANOVA revealed a significant group main effect and a significant time × group interaction effect. At post-assessment, outcome expectations were higher in the DP group than in the OLP group. Acceptance of the placebo treatment was also higher in the DP\xa0group than in the OLP group. Mediation analyses confirmed that higher acceptance in the DP group was mediated by higher expectations. Conclusions When laypersons read about placebo treatment, their outcome expectations toward DPs were higher than toward OLPs. Surprisingly, the application of DPs was rated as more acceptable than OLPs. This result might be explained by indirect effects of treatment expectations.']","['Haas, Julia W., [Rief, Winfried], [Doering, Bettina K.]']",['10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12529-020-09933-1'],[''],['Open-Label Placebo Treatment: Outcome Expectations and General Acceptance in the Lay Population']

Likewise, in Mauritius, a regulation banning the use of plastic bags was introduced in 2016. Whether this regulation has been successful in stopping the usage of banned plastic bags or not, is the overall objective of the present study. The study was conducted on the Mauritian population. It equally investigated: the quantity of plastic bags utilized before and after regulation; the alternatives to plastic bags used; the level of awareness on environmental and health impacts resulting from indiscriminate disposal of plastic bags; and the perception of the regulation. 65% of the respondent population claimed that the regulation has failed to prohibit the usage of banned plastic bags.

The current study was designed to assess the influence of a week-long, academically interdisciplinary spatial reasoning Bootcamp on a small, diverse group of female participants’ spatial reasoning abilities and to determine if Participants’ subsequent performance in organic chemistry and physics coursework differed from that of a Match (non-Bootcamp participant) Control group. The data indicate that Bootcamp participants significantly improved their scores in some commonly accepted measures of spatial reasoning abilities and that Bootcamp participants’ final grades in organic chemistry, but not physics, were significantly higher than the Match Control group.

Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of: sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments. We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in Practice to characterize the PSTs’ perceptions of their experience of formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students, in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on average less confidence in assessing school student task responses themselves than in assessing peer work.

"['Purpose Malnutrition is a co-morbidity of head and neck cancer (HNC) that has negative consequences for patients. Evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) provide recommendations to prevent and manage malnutrition. A clinic that combines the services of a dietitian, specialist oncology nurse and speech pathologist may promote the implementation of nutritional EBGs in regional Australia. This study aimed to explore the nutritional care experience that patients with HNC had in this setting. Methods A qualitative longitudinal study collected data via semi-structured interviews with HNC patients who were treated in one regional cancer care network in Australia. Interviews were conducted at key points in their HNC journey from diagnosis to 4\xa0months post-radiotherapy. Data was analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results Ten participants completed a total of thirty-six interviews. The findings were grouped into four categories: “preparing for nutritional challenges”, “multidisciplinary care directed by patient needs”, “the battle to eat”, and “incongruence between patient values and nutritional priorities”. Conclusion These findings highlight the nutritional burden associated with HNC and barriers to patients accepting nutritional support from healthcare professionals. Information provided by doctors and nurses prior to treatment may help patients prepare for the nutritional challenges ahead and accept support from dietitians. Furthermore, clinics that promote continuity through treatment and allow dietitians to lead aspects of nutritional care, in collaboration with nurses, speech pathologists and doctors, may also enhance the nutritional care experience. More qualitative research within HNC teams would provide further insight on enhancing the implementation of nutritional EBGs to improve outcomes for these patients.']","['Hazzard, Emily, [Haughton, Jennifer], [Fish, Janaye], [Milosavljevic, Marianna], [Dickson, Vhari], [Boehm, Jessica], [Walton, Karen], [Ashford, Bruce]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05917-9'],[''],"['The experience of nutritional care according to patients with head and neck cancer involved with a combined dietitian, specialist nurse and speech pathologist clinic in a regional Australia: a qualitative longitudinal study']"

Both individuals were positively food-conditioned and showed increasing habituation caused by irresponsible behaviour of people such as long-lasting intentional feeding or illegal keeping.

A key component for the successful renewable energy sources integration is the usage of energy storage. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling framework for the strategic participation of energy storage in the European continuous intraday market where exchanges occur through a centralized order book. The goal of the storage device operator is the maximization of the profits received over the entire trading horizon, while taking into account the operational constraints of the unit. The sequential decision-making problem of trading in the intraday market is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. An asynchronous version of the fitted Q iteration algorithm is chosen for solving this problem due to its sample efficiency. The large and variable number of the existing orders in the order book motivates the use of high-level actions and an alternative state representation. Historical data are used for the generation of a large number of artificial trajectories in order to address exploration issues during the learning process. The resulting policy is back-tested and compared against a number of benchmark strategies. Finally, the impact of the storage characteristics on the total revenues collected in the intraday market is evaluated.']","['Boukas, Ioannis, [Ernst, Damien], [Théate, Thibaut], [Bolland, Adrien], [Huynen, Alexandre], [Buchwald, Martin], [Wynants, Christelle], [Cornélusse, Bertrand]']",['10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06020-8'],[''],['A deep reinforcement learning framework for continuous intraday market bidding']

"['Babesia orientalis , belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, is mainly accountable for water buffalo babesiosis, which adversely affected the livestock industry in China. Variant erythrocyte surface antigen-1 (VESA1), an antigen that helps infected erythrocytes to escape from host immune responses, was first reported in Babesia bovis. Various VESA1 proteins have also been characterized in other Babesia species. Nevertheless, there is no research on the identification and characterization of VESA1 proteins in Babesia orientalis. In this study, the BoVESA1 gene was amplified from both gDNA and cDNA. The results revealed that it is an intronless gene with a full length of 753\xa0bp, encoding a protein of 250 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 28\xa0kDa. The coding sequence (CDS) was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector using a homologous recombination kit and expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein with a molecular weight of 53\xa0kDa. The tertiary structure of BoVESA1 was predicted using the I-TASSER software. The recombinant protein was subjected to western blotting; the immunogenicity of recombinant BoVESA1 (rBoVESA1) was identified by incubating it with B. orientalis -positive serum. The native BoVESA1 was identified using the lysates of B. orientalis -infected water buffalo erythrocytes incubated with the anti-rBoVESA1 mouse serum. The results showed a band of\u2009~\u200928\xa0kDa, which is similar to the predicted size. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-rBoVESA1 serum probed indicated a strong signal in the infected RBCs, while the negative control showed no signal.

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

We conducted a cross-sectional study combining serological and molecular tests to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp. infections in dogs in two hyperendemic foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately owned dogs (417 from Goiana municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, and 213 from São Joaquim de Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil) were sampled and molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall, 519 dogs (82.4%) presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity was significantly higher in dogs older than 1\xa0year.

"['Cattle ranching is one of the main production activities in the Neotropics that has unavoidably led to cattle exposure to the common vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) and rabies virus. Although many studies have assessed this issue, the influence of environmental characteristics associated with land use and social and production constraints have received little attention. We used satellite imagery classification to identify a gradient of landscape disturbance and analyzed the effects of cattle management and landscape structure on common vampire bat abundance and feeding prevalence. Evidence of the common vampire bat feeding on cattle was common in the study area: 87.5% of the ranchers interviewed claimed to have experienced this problem. The abundance and feeding prevalence of the common vampire bat was lower in landscapes dominated by open fields, scarce forest cover, and agricultural land. Bat abundance was positively associated with the presence of streams in the proximity of grazing areas, whereas cave’s presence was associated with higher feeding prevalence. We suggest that cattle grazing should avoid the proximity of streams, caves, and forests as much as possible, as these conditions increase the exposure of cattle to the common vampire bat and the potential for feeding, which can increase the likelihood of rabies virus transmission.']","['Mendoza-Sáenz, Víctor Hugo, [Navarrete-Gutiérrez, Darío Alejandro], [Jiménez-Ferrer, Guillermo], [Kraker-Castañeda, Cristian], [Saldaña-Vázquez, Romeo A.]']",['10.1007/s13364-021-00572-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-021-00572-9'],[''],['Abundance of the common vampire bat and feeding prevalence on cattle along a gradient of landscape disturbance in southeastern Mexico']
"['Background Bovine tropical theileriosis (BTT) is a haemoprotozoan tick-borne disease that implicates huge losses to livestock in terms of considerable mortality and morbidity in tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. Currently available diagnostic methods have less specificity and sensitivity towards the detection of Theileria species. Therefore, an attempt was made to diagnose Theileria annulata by targeting a multi-copy gene, viz. mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b (MT-CYB) gene via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different agro-zones of India. Methods and Results 129 cattle blood samples were collected from major livestock rearing regions of India and processed for both molecular and microscopic techniques. Screening of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears was able to detect 14 samples (10.85%) as positive for T. annulata. However, the MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay detected 107 samples (82.94%) positive for T. annulata out of 129 samples. Furthermore, the MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay was standardized in terms of its sensitivity and specificity. Specificity of PCR assay was evaluated against other common haemoprotozoan parasites of tropical countries viz. Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Trypanosoma evansi . The multi-copy MT-CYB gene-based PCR assay provided an optimum level of sensitivity (up to the level of 10 femtogram) and high specificity. Haematological examination (Hb, PCV and TLC) of 113 samples revealed significantly ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) decreased Hb and PCV levels in positive animals in comparison with the control group of healthy animals. However, the control group had significantly higher ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) TLC levels than the positive group.

Trypanosoma evansi infection was confirmed by microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Non-infected clinically healthy dogs ( n \u2009=\u20096) served as control. Blood samples were collected to study the haemogram and serum samples were used for the evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and oxidant-antioxidant parameters . Results During the study period, an overall incidence of 0.25% was recorded for trypanosomosis in dogs. The most consistent clinical findings noticed were anorexia/inappetence, pyrexia, depression/lethargy, pale mucous membrane, dehydration and lymphadenomegaly. Anaemia, granulocytopenia, lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia were the major findings noticed in trypanosomosis affected dogs. The profile of vital organ function revealed that the mean values of total protein, albumin and random blood glucose were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower, whereas the mean values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher in dogs affected with trypanosomosis.

"['Purpose Ehrlichiosis is one of the tick-borne diseases, which is not only neglected in Pakistan but only a few reports have been documented throughout the globe. The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease.

"['Background Improved knowledge on vector-borne pathogens in wildlife will help determine their effect on host species at the population and individual level and whether these are affected by anthropogenic factors such as global climate change and landscape changes. Here, samples from brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea ) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA ( n \u2009=\u200917), SHNA ( n \u2009=\u200919) and SHTZ ( n \u2009=\u200925) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau -like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum / platys -like and Anaplasma bovis -like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau -like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli -like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis -like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1–4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2–4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0–4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia , multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group. Ecological conditions explained pathogen identity and diversity better than host taxonomy.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The microscope slides mostly showed piriform and oval merozoites measuring greater than 2.5\xa0µm in length, which were compatible with B. vogeli . However, smaller forms were also identified, thus demonstrating the polymorphic nature of this parasite.

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world.

"['Background The speed with which acaricides paralyze and kill ticks is relevant to impeding pathogen transmission. The objective of this study was to assess early-onset lotilaner effects on the motility and weights of Amblyomma americanum ticks collected from treated dogs. Methods Twelve healthy dogs were randomized between two groups to receive either lotilaner (Credelio ® ) on Day 0 or to be sham treated. On Day 7, 25 male and 25 female A. americanum were placed under bandages, two on each flank of each dog. After 30 or 45\xa0min, all unattached ticks were removed and T \u2009=\u20090 was set. At T \u2009=\u20092, 4, 8 and 24\xa0h post attachment, 5 attached ticks removed from each bandage on each dog were weighed, assessed by blinded observers for righting ability and movement recorded. Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean tick weights from the treated group were significantly lower at 24\xa0h than at earlier time points ( P male \u2009<\u20090.0307; P female \u2009=\u20090.0021). At 4 and 8\xa0h, significantly fewer ticks from treated (14.3%, 0.0%, respectively) than from control dogs could right (73.3%, 70.0%) ( P 4h \u2009<\u20090.0001; P 8h \u2009=\u20090.0024) (at 24\xa0h, all ticks from treated dogs were dead), and distance moved was significantly less at all time points ( P 2h \u2009=\u20090.0413; P 4h , P 8h \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean and maximum velocity of ticks from treated dogs were significantly lower, relative to controls, at 4 and 8\xa0h ( P \u2009≤\u20090.0001). Within the treated group, collected ticks had significantly lower mean and maximum velocities at 4 and 8\xa0h compared to 2\xa0h ( P mean \u2009<\u20090.0042; P max \u2009<\u20090.0194).

Those irreversible changes could substantially reduce the risk of pathogen transmission from tick to host.']","['Wenger, Martha J., [Kollasch, Todd M.], [Burke, Madeline C.], [Jones, Livvy], [Locklear, Casey], [Hedberg, Makaela], [Miller, Lauren], [Reeves, Sydnie], [Ritchie, Debra], [Rumschlag, Anthony J.], [Ryan, William G.], [Smith, Vicki], [Sutherland, Cameron], [Reif, Kathryn E.], [Herrin, Brian H.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04817-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04817-z'],[''],['Early onset of pre-lethal effects of lotilaner (Credelio®) on Amblyomma americanum ticks on experimentally infested dogs']
"['Background Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and is highly lethal in humans and dogs if left untreated. The frequency of this parasite and associated histological changes in the pancreas of dogs are poorly studied. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency of detection and load of amastigotes in the pancreas of L. infantum -seropositive dogs and to identify the clinical signs and histological changes associated with parasitism of this organ. Methods One hundred forty-three dogs from an endemic area in Brazil that tested seropositive for L. infantum were studied. The dogs were clinically examined, killed, and necropsied between 2013 and 2014. One fragment of the pancreas was randomly collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry, and spleen and bone marrow were collected for culture. Results Leishmania amastigotes were detected in the pancreas of 22 dogs (15.4%) by immunohistochemistry, all exhibiting L. infantum parasitism in the spleen and/or bone marrow. Poor body condition and cachexia were only associated with infection of the pancreas with Leishmania spp. ( p \u2009=\u20090.021) and were found in 40.9% of dogs with pancreatic infection. Anorexia, vomiting, and/or diarrhea were observed in 9.2% of dogs with pancreatitis. The median parasite load in the pancreas was 1.4 infected macrophages/mm 2 . Pancreatic histological changes and their frequencies were: granulomatous pancreatitis (28.0%), lymphoplasmacytic pancreatitis (23.8%), acinar cell degeneration (6.3%), fibrosis (5.6%), hemorrhage (2.1%), eosinophilic pancreatitis (0.7%), suppurative pancreatitis (0.7%), and necrosis (0.7%). Conclusions The present results demonstrate that L. infantum is one of the etiological agents of chronic pancreatitis in dogs; however, the frequency of detection and parasite load are low in this organ. The lack of an association of poor body condition and cachexia with pancreatitis and the low frequency of clinical signs commonly associated with pancreatitis suggest that a significant portion of the organ is not affected by this parasite. On the other hand, the association of poor body condition and cachexia with concomitant infection of the pancreas, spleen, and/or bone marrow with this parasite suggests that these manifestations are the result of a more advanced stage of canine visceral leishmaniasis.

"['Aptamers are small nucleic acids that fold in a three-dimensional conformation allowing them to bind specifically to a target. This target can be an organic molecule, free or carried in cells or tissues, or inorganic components, such as metal ions. Analogous to monoclonal antibodies, aptamers however have certain advantages over the latter: e.g., high specificity for their target, no to low immunogenicity and easy in vitro selection. Since their discovery more than 30\xa0years ago, aptamers have led to various applications, although mainly restricted to basic research. This work reviews the applications of aptamers in veterinary science to date. First, we present aptamers, how they are selected and their properties, then we give examples of applications in food and environmental safety, as well as in diagnosis and medical treatment in the field of veterinary medicine. Because examples of applications in veterinary medicine are scarce, we explore the potential avenues for future applications based on discoveries made in human medicine. Aptamers may offer new possibilities for veterinarians to diagnose certain diseases—particularly infectious diseases—more rapidly or “at the patient’s bedside”.

The prevalence rate was higher in cattle (51.58%) than buffaloes (40.89%) and the difference was statistically significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). Indigenous cattle (59.30%) showed higher seropositivity than crossbreed (57.16%) and exotic cattle breeds (42.28%). Although statistically not significant, female (52.37%) showed higher seropositivity than male (46.43%). Similarly, significant difference in prevalence ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) was observed for animals reared in different climatic zones with highest prevalence recorded in arid zone (90.49%) and lowest in semi-arid zone (29.83%). Very wide variation in prevalence (9.95–100%) was recorded between farms. The present study indicates endemicity of Anaplasma in India, similar to other tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Endemic instability was recorded in some of the studied farms suggesting possibility of outbreak of new clinical cases resulting in economic loss. Therefore, suitable policies and procedures for prevention and control of Anaplasma infection should be adopted in these farms.']","['Sarangi, Laxmi Narayan, [Rana, Samir Kumar], [Prasad, Amitesh], [Ponnanna, Nadikerianda Muthappa], [Sharma, Girish Kumar]']",['10.1007/s12639-020-01312-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-020-01312-7'],[''],['Prevalence of antibodies to Anaplasma in cattle and buffaloes of different organized herds in India']
"['Introduction Anaplasma sp. is an obligatory intracellular Gram-negative tick-transmitted bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. Oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline are the drugs of choice for treating domestic animals with acute anaplasmosis. Lack of documented information about oxytetracycline resistance in Anaplasma species in the world was the scope of this study to screen by PCR for the detection of the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in Anaplasma species from infected cattle and sheep in the Northwest and Southwest of Iran. Materials and Methods Total of 100 cattle and sheep blood samples collected from 2 provinces in the Northwest and 1 province in the Southwest of Iran were tested microscopically by the Giemsa staining examination and confirmed by PCR. Then the presence of two different oxytetracycline-resistance genes ( otrA, and otrB ) was detected by PCR in positive samples. Results The results showed that 60% of Anaplasma -infected samples were identified to have an otrA -resistance gene, and 26.67% had an otrB -resistance gene. The coexistence of two oxytetracycline-resistance determinants was encountered in 13.33% of the isolates. The significant difference in the frequency of otr genes was found among three Anaplasma species ( A. marginale , A. centrale and A. ovis ), and among three studied regions in Iran ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The identified sequences were submitted to the GenBank and deposited under accession numbers MN880729 and MN895439 for otrB and otrA genes. Conclusion This study, for the first time, indicated the oxytetracycline-resistance genes in the three most prevalent Anaplasma species in ruminants. This finding helps to select an appropriate treatment strategy for eradication of anaplasmosis.']","['Shahbazi, Parisa, [Nouri Gharajalar, Sahar], [Mohebbi, Kolsoum], [Taeb, Jafar], [Hashemzadeh Farhang, Hosein], [Nikvand, Ali Abbas], [Norouzi, Roghayeh]']",['10.1007/s11686-020-00306-y'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00306-y'],[''],['First Survey on the Presence and Distribution of Oxytetracycline-Resistance Genes in Anaplasma Species']
"['Cryptosporidiosis is an imperative global health concern. Unfortunately, Nitazoxanide (NTZ) (the nowadays drug of choice) is not effective in treatment of immunocompromised patients.

Mice were divided into five groups; GI: received Mefloquine (400\xa0mg/kg/day), GII: received NTZ (100\xa0mg/kg/bid), GIII: received a combination, half dose regimen of both drugs, GIV: infected untreated and GV: non-infected untreated. Each treated group was divided into three subgroups; Ga prophylaxis (PX), thereafter infection, Gb first and Gc second treatment doses. Assessment was done by parasitological, histopathological and serological techniques. A significant oocyst clearance was detected in all prophylactically treated groups. GIa showed 77% reduction of the mean oocyst count in stool while GIb and GIIIc showed100% oocyst clearance. Histopathologically, the ileocecal sections from GIV showed loss of brush borders with marked villous atrophy. GIa induced a moderate improvement of those pathological changes. Moreover, the villi in GIb and GIIIc retained their normal appearance with minimal inflammatory cells. Serum interferon gamma levels showed highly significant increases in GI&GIII compared to GIV while a non-significant increase was observed in GIIa only. On the contrary, serum interleukin-17 levels showed a highly significant down-regulation in all treated groups in comparison to GIV.

Control of ticks being central to the control of fatal tick-borne diseases, this study attempted to assess the susceptibility/resistance of brown dog ticks to synthetic pyrethroids, the commonly used acaricides against ticks. Larval packet assay revealed 60% of isolates tested to be resistant and tolerant to deltamethrin as per the resistance factor that ranged from 1 to 53.7. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplified product of domain II S4-5 linker of sodium channel gene in R. sanguineus revealed novel polymorphisms, viz., C190A, G215T and T270C. In domain III S6 region of the gene, a T2134C mutation was observed. Genotyping with allele-specific PCR targeting domain II S4-5 linker region using single larvae revealed that most R. sanguineus larvae in the study population were homozygous resistant (RR) genotypes, followed by heterozygous (RS) and homozygous susceptible (SS) genotypes. A higher proportion of RS genotypes was also observed in domain III S6 region.

We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%).

"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks.

"['Background Various tick-borne infections like borreliosis and rickettsiosis pose a health risk to humans in many parts of the world. We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. Methods Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. Results Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. Conclusions Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti- Borrelia -antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years. Rickettsiosis is of limited concern in Denmark.

"['Background African tick bite fever (ATBF) caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by Amblyomma spp. ticks is one of the zoonotic tick-borne fevers from the spotted fever group (SFG) of rickettsiae, which is an emerging global health concern. There is paucity of information regarding the occurrence and awareness of the disease in endemic rural livestock farming communities living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. Methods The purpose of the study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices on ticks and ATBF infection from a community living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. A focus group discussion (FGD) was carried out followed by verbal administration of a standardized semi-structured questionnaire a month later to 38 rural livestock farmers (23 from Caquba area and 15 from Lucingweni area where A. hebraeum was absent). An FGD was conducted in Caquba (situated at the livestock-wildlife interface where Amblyomma hebraeum was prevalent on cattle and infected with Rickettsia africae ) in the O.R. Tambo district of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Results Results from the FGD and questionnaire survey showed that participants from the two rural communities were not aware of ATBF and were not aware that ticks are vectors of the disease. Respondents from Caquba reported of having frequent exposure to tick bites (91.3%, 21/23) specifically from the anthropophilic A. hebrauem which they were able to identify as Qwelagqibe in IsiXhosa (their vernacular). Thirteen out of 15 (86.7%) of respondents from Lucingweni reported that they had never been bitten by ticks, which corresponded with the absence of A. hebraeum from their locality as evidenced from results of a concurrent study on prevalence of ticks on livestock in the area. Both communities confirmed to being “very concerned” of tick bites and we presume this was more related to the localized wounds from the bites than to the diseases transmitted by the ticks.

"['Background The significance of tick-borne diseases has increased considerably in recent years. Because of the unique distribution of the tick species Dermacentor reticulatus in Poland, comprising two expanding populations, Eastern and Western that are separated by a Dermacentor -free zone, it is important to conduct studies on the process of tick expansion and emergence of canine babesiosis. The main aim of the current study was to monitor the expansion of D. reticulatus populations from spring 2016 to autumn 2018 to determine (1) the actual geographical range of this tick species, and (2) and the seasonal/annual shift in range limits and changes in distance between Western and Eastern populations of ticks (the size of the non-endemic area). Methods Ticks were collected in spring/autumn during a 3-year study. From each season and year at least three pairs of sites from the Western and Eastern populations were selected. Then the mean distance between paired sites was calculated for each season and year. We collected and analyzed data from veterinary clinics on the number of canine babesiosis cases treated in the clinic during a whole year (2018). Results Accordingly, further expansion of the two D. reticulatus populations was recorded, mainly along river basins. Marked colonization of the gap zone was observed, with a mean annual shift in the range of 2.5–10 km and a steadily decreasing distance between the two tick populations. The occurrence of babesiosis in different regions revealed low numbers of cases in Western Poland (19 cases/year) and the gap area (only 7 cases/year) and high incidence (up to 250 cases/1000 dogs) and fatality (total 3.65%) in Central and Eastern Poland. Strong associations were found geographically between tick and babesiosis occurrence and temporally in the seasonal patterns of occurrence of ticks and outbreaks of babesiosis. Conclusions We documented the shift in range limits and continued process of colonization of the gap zone accompanied by the emergence of canine babesiosis in the Eastern expansion zone. Updated maps of the distribution of ticks and occurrence of babesiosis in different regions of Poland have allowed us to predict of the emergence of pathogens vectored by D. reticulatus.

Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected. The novel duplex RT-PCR assay provided correct classification of samples positive and negative for B. canis and A. phagocytophilum . The analytical sensitivity of this assay was ten gene copies/ reaction for both pathogens. Conclusions A novel duplex RT-PCR molecular method was developed for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Sequence variability of Bc28.1 and mdh genes indicated the genetic variability of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum isolates occurring in Latvian domestic dogs.

"['Background The emergence of tick-borne disease is increasing because of the effects of the temperature rise driven by global warming. In Turkey, 19 pathogens transmitted by ticks to humans and animals have been reported. Based on this, this study aimed to investigate tick-borne pathogens including Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., and Bartonella spp. in tick samples ( n = 110) collected from different hosts (dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and turtles) by molecular methods. Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected. Hepatozoon spp. was detected in R. sanguineus ticks while Theileria spp. , Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected in R. turanicus and H. marginatum . According to the results of sequence analyses applied for pathogen positive samples, Hepatozoon canis , Theileria ovis , Babesia caballi , and Anaplasma ovis were identified. Conclusion Theileria ovis and Anaplasma ovis were detected for the first time to our knowledge in H. marginatum and R. turanicus collected from Turkey, respectively.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures.

"['Background Plants perform in a specific Eh–pH spectrum and they rely on various processes to ensure their homeostasis, which plays a central role in their defense. The effects of multiple stresses, all translated into oxidative stress into the plant, and the capacity of the latter to respond to these stresses results in specific Eh–pH states in plants. Scope We reviewed plant-invertebrate pests and plant-pathogens interactions under a Eh–pH homeostasis perspective by extensively analyzing the literature, which converges and supports a set of hypotheses. We report examples showing how the development and attacks of pests are correlated to spatio-temporal variations of Eh–pH in plants. We provide evidence-based discussion on how Eh–pH homeostasis can open a new perspective on plant health, and help unravel and disentangle the many Genotype x Environment x Management x Pest and Pathogen interactions. We propose an original perspective on energy allocation and growth-defense tradeoff by plants based on the Eh–pH homeostasis model. Finally, we show how Eh–pH conditions in the rhizosphere are the results of multiple interactions between the root system and microorganisms. Based on this, we hypothesize that soil suppressiveness is derived from soil structure leading to diverse Eh–pH niches that harbor a diversity of microorganisms.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence.

"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%).

The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.

"['Extracellular vesicles are thought to facilitate pathogen transmission from arthropods to humans and other animals. Here, we reveal that pathogen spreading from arthropods to the mammalian host is multifaceted. Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases. Extracellular vesicles have been implicated in the transmission of pathogens from the arthropod to the human host. Here the authors show that tick-derived extracellular vesicles play a role in feeding and modulate the outcome of bacterial infection.']","['Oliva Chávez, Adela S., [Wang, Xiaowei], [Marnin, Liron], [Archer, Nathan K.], [Hammond, Holly L.], [Carroll, Erin E.

"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Several studies have indicated that these changes are likely to accelerate in the future and cause an adverse impact on the environment. The Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, especially Amathole District Municipality (ADM), has recorded a high number of climate change–related disasters including prolonged drought conditions witnessed during the winter season of 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2015 among others. Consequently, this study aimed at exploring remote sensing information to assess and document drought occurrences in the ADM from 2007 to 2017.

For the analysis, a total of 396 satellite imageries (MODIS and TRMM) were used. The results revealed that different correlations exist between the three variables. The significance of correlations differed from one season to another. Furthermore, it was revealed that the drought conditions in the district differed in the spatial distribution. The study accurately identified the drought episodes that occurred in the ADM in the years 2008, 2009, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n \u2009=\u200929), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n \u2009=\u20096), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n \u2009=\u200914) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n \u2009=\u200917) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"
"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities.

"['Background The blood feeding poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae , causes substantial economic damage to the egg laying industry worldwide, and is a serious welfare concern for laying hens and poultry house workers. In this study we have investigated the temporal gene expression across the 6 stages/sexes (egg, larvae, protonymph and deutonymph, adult male and adult female) of this neglected parasite in order to understand the temporal expression associated with development, parasitic lifestyle, reproduction and allergen expression. Results RNA-seq transcript data for the 6 stages were mapped to the PRM genome creating a publicly available gene expression atlas (on the OrcAE platform in conjunction with the PRM genome). Network analysis and clustering of stage-enriched gene expression in PRM resulted in 17 superclusters with stage-specific or multi-stage expression profiles. The 6 stage specific superclusters were clearly demarked from each other and the adult female supercluster contained the most stage specific transcripts (2725), whilst the protonymph supercluster the fewest (165). Fifteen pairwise comparisons performed between the different stages resulted in a total of 6025 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) ( P \u2009>\u20090.99). These data were evaluated alongside a Venn/Euler analysis of the top 100 most abundant genes in each stage. An expanded set of cuticle proteins and enzymes (chitinase and metallocarboxypeptidases) were identified in larvae and underpin cuticle formation and ecdysis to the protonymph stage. Two mucin/peritrophic-A salivary proteins (DEGAL6771g00070, DEGAL6824g00220) were highly expressed in the blood-feeding stages, indicating peritrophic membrane formation during feeding. Reproduction-associated vitellogenins were the most abundant transcripts in adult females whilst, in adult males, an expanded set of serine and cysteine proteinases and an epididymal protein (DEGAL6668g00010) were highly abundant. Assessment of the expression patterns of putative homologues of 32 allergen groups from house dust mites indicated a bias in their expression towards the non-feeding larval stage of PRM. Conclusions This study is the first evaluation of temporal gene expression across all stages of PRM and has provided insight into developmental, feeding, reproduction and survival strategies employed by this mite. The publicly available PRM resource on OrcAE offers a valuable tool for researchers investigating the biology and novel interventions of this parasite.']","['Bartley, Kathryn, [Chen, Wan], [Lloyd Mills, Richard I.], [Nunn, Francesca], [Price, Daniel R.

Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development.

"['Background Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed.']","['Cameron, Laura, [Rocque, Rhéa], [Penner, Kailey], [Mauro, Ian]']",['10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],[''],"['Public perceptions of Lyme disease and climate change in southern Manitoba, Canada: making a case for strategic decoupling of climate and health messages']"
"['Malaria is a principal cause of illness and death in countries where the disease is endemic. Personal protection against mosquitoes using repellents could be a useful method that can reduce and/or prevent transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The available repellent products, such as creams, roll-ons, and sprays for personal protection against mosquitoes, lack adequate long-term efficacy. In most cases, they need to be re-applied or replaced frequently. The encapsulation and release of the repellents from several matrices has risen as an alternative process for the development of invention of repellent based systems. The present work reviews various studies about the development and use of repellent controlled-release formulations such as polymer microcapsules, polymer microporous formulations, polymer micelles, nanoemulsions, solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes and cyclodextrins as new tools for mosquito-borne malaria control in the outdoor environment. Furthermore, investigation on the mathematical modelling used for the release rate of repellents is discussed in depth by exploring the Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Weibull models, as well as the recently developed Mapossa model. Therefore, the studies searched suggest that the final repellents based-product should not only be effective against mosquito vectors of malaria parasites, but also reduce the biting frequency of other mosquitoes transmitting diseases, such as dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus.

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato\xa0(s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2\xa0years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects\xa0models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Results We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2\xa0years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l.\xa0and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Conclusions Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.']","['Bregnard, Cindy, [Rais, Olivier], [Voordouw, Maarten Jeroen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],[''],['Masting by beech trees predicts the risk of Lyme disease']
"['Phenology is a fundamental determinant of species distributions, abundances, and interactions. In host–parasite interactions, host phenology can affect parasite fitness due to the temporal constraints it imposes on host contact rates. However, it remains unclear how parasite transmission is shaped by the wide range of phenological patterns observed in nature. We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi . Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics. These results highlight the importance of phenology, a common driver of species interactions, for the fitness of a parasite.']","['MacDonald, Hannelore, [Akçay, Erol], [Brisson, Dustin]']",['10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],[''],['The role of host phenology for parasite transmission']

We assessed the relative influence of such factors on patterns of infection by Austrodiplostomum compactum (Digenea, Diplostomidae) in fish assemblages of the Upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil. Multiple infection parameters were modeled at the community and species levels using phylogenetic diversity (PD), abundance (total and for a main reservoir species Plagioscion squamosissimus ), local environmental conditions and phylogenetic distance from P. squamosissimus (Dis_Plag). In total, 108 fish species were collected and 28 were infected. At the community level, mean parasite abundance and mean infection intensity were positively associated with PD and the interaction between PD and environmental conditions, whereas host richness was negatively associated with PD. The complementary results indicate a biodiversity sampling effect rather than dilution effect. Environmental conditions often had the strongest coefficients in community-level models and mediated associations between infection parameters and other factors. At the species level, consistent negative associations between infection parameters and Dis_Plag indicate phylogenetic niche conservatism of parasites. Integration of community and species-level analyses demonstrates that phylogenetic diversity can affect host–parasite interactions in multiple ways, but that the associations depend on phylogenetic relationships and environmental conditions.']","['Lima-Junior, Dilermando Pereira, [Bellay, Sybelle], [Hoeinghaus, David J.], [Bini, Luis Mauricio], [Lima, Luciano B.], [Yotoko, Karla], [Agostinho, Angelo Antônio]']",['10.1007/s10750-020-04509-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04509-2'],[''],"['Host diversity, phylogenetic relationships and local environmental factors drive infection patterns of a non-native parasite in tropical floodplain fish assemblages']"

"['Ticks (Arachnida: Acari) are vectors for pathogens and the biggest threat to animal health. Many Australian ticks are associated with pathogens that impact humans, domestic animals and livestock. However, little is known about the presence or impact of tick-borne pathogens in native Australian wildlife. Wombats are particularly susceptible to the effects of the ectoparasite Sarcoptes scabiei which causes sarcoptic mange, the reason for which is unknown. Factors such as other ectoparasites and their associated pathogens may play a role. A critical understanding of the species of ectoparasites that parasitise wombats and their pathogens, and particularly ticks, is therefore warranted. This review describes the ectoparasites of wombats, pathogens known to be associated with those ectoparasites, and related literature gaps. Pathogens have been isolated in most tick species that typically feed on wombats; however, there are minimal molecular studies to determine the presence of pathogens in any other wombat ectoparasites. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allows us to explore entire microbial communities in ectoparasite samples, allowing fast and accurate identification of potential pathogens in many samples at once. These new techniques have highlighted the diversity and uniqueness of native ticks and their microbiomes, including pathogens of potential medical and veterinary importance.

"['Abstract Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards ( Sceloporus occidentalis ) are a key host to western blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus ). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures, or both. We infested adult males with larval ticks for 7 to 10 days, staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits, for either infested or uninfested males. There was also no effect of tick attachment location and hemoparasite infection on host contest behavior. This is the first demonstration of the impact of I. pacificus parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness. Because I. pacificus rely heavily on these lizards for blood meals and dispersal, these impacts could also influence the abundance of ticks and the pathogens they vector. Significance statement Parasitism frequently impairs host behavior. We investigated the effect of blacklegged tick parasitism on western fence lizard contest behavior using a lab-based manipulation experiment. We demonstrated that tick infestation reduced lizard aggressiveness, which may lead to territory loss and reduced mating opportunities in the wild. We found no evidence that host body size or coloration\xa0are correlated with aggression.

"['Background The lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), an important vector of a wide range of human and animal pathogens, is very common throughout the East and Midwest of the USA. Ticks are known to carry non-pathogenic bacteria that may play a role in their vector competence for pathogens. Several previous studies using the high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies reported the commensal bacteria in a tick midgut as abundant and diverse. In contrast, in our preliminary survey of the field collected adult lone star ticks, we found the number of culturable/viable bacteria very low. Methods We aimed to analyze the bacterial community of A. americanum by a parallel culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach applied to individual ticks. Results We analyzed 94 adult females collected in eastern Kansas and found that 60.8% of ticks had no culturable bacteria and the remaining ticks carried only 67.7\u2009±\u200942.8 colony-forming units (CFUs)/tick representing 26 genera.

Remaining OTUs with very low abundance were typical soil bacterial taxa indicating their environmental origin. Conclusions No correlation was found between the CFU abundance and the relative abundance from the culture-independent approach. This suggests that many culturable taxa detected by HTS but not by culture-dependent method were not viable or were not in their culturable state.

Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas.

The response to these challenges requires community participation in the adaptation of animal production systems to new environments and strengthening the efficiency of veterinary services delivery combined with well-coordinated public health services, since many emerging human diseases are zoonotic.']","['Magiri, Royford, [Muzandu, Kaampwe], [Gitau, George], [Choongo, Kennedy], [Iji, Paul]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-45106-6_19'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45106-6_19'],[''],"['Impact of Climate Change on Animal Health, Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases in Africa']"

"['Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) act as important vectors of zoonotic pathogens. For instance, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes pose a severe health risk as aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis. Commonly, to study the abundance of questing (host-seeking) ticks, a 1 m 2 piece of cloth is dragged over vegetation for a determined distance. Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased.']","['Nyrhilä, Siiri, [Sormunen, Jani J.], [Mäkelä, Satu], [Sippola, Ella], [Vesterinen, Eero J.], [Klemola, Tero]']",['10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],[''],['One out of ten: low sampling efficiency of cloth dragging challenges abundance estimates of questing ticks']
"[""In this work, we discussed and counter-commented Paul J. Weldon's comments on our recent paper (Zhou et al.

The main question we arise in this response is: “which is the reasonable target of BCP/BCPO? Parasites or TRPM8?” Based on the knowledge of TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation, interaction between BCP/BCPO and TRPM8, BCP/BCPO concentration in horse manure samples, correlation between HMR frequency and habitat temperature, insecticidal activity of BCP/BCPO and thermal ecology of parasites, we prefer a simple idea that BCP/BCPO-induced TRPM8 antagonism bestows the wild giant pandas with cold tolerance at low-ambient temperatures. Compared with the speculation of insecticidal activity induced by HMR behavior, our study provided a comprehensive mechanism to confirm a physiological target of BCP/BCPO during the highly cold-correlated behavior.""]","['Zhou, Wenliang, [Yang, Shilong], [Lai, Ren], [Wei, Fuwen]']",['10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-021-00344-6'],[''],['How two sesquiterpenes drive horse manure rolling behavior in wild giant pandas']

In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools.

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses. This study provides the groundwork for assessing stress tolerance in this bipolar ectoparasite.']","['Davies, Benjamin, [Rosendale, Andrew J.], [Gantz, Josiah D.], [Lee, Richard E., Jr.], [Denlinger, David L.], [Benoit, Joshua B.]']",['10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],[''],"['Cross-tolerance and transcriptional shifts underlying abiotic stress in the seabird tick, Ixodes uriae']"
"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

However, there is currently no web-based or mobile application that supports automated classification of tick images. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s). These results demonstrate that, with limited data size for model training, a simple shallow custom-built CNN model has great prospects for use in the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Saeedpour-Parizi, Mohammad R.], [Rahman, Md.

"['Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']
"['Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), as they occur in insects, form a distinct class of proteins that apparently has no closely related representatives in other animals. However, ticks, mites, spiders and millipedes contain genes encoding proteins with sequence similarity to insect OBPs. In this work, we have explored the structure and function of such non-insect OBPs in the mite Varroa destructor , a major pest of honey bee. Varroa OBPs present six cysteines paired into three disulphide bridges, but with positions in the sequence and connections different from those of their insect counterparts. VdesOBP1 structure was determined in two closely related crystal forms and appears to be a monomer. Its structure assembles five α-helices linked by three disulphide bridges, one of them exhibiting a different connection as compared to their insect counterparts. Comparison with classical OBPs reveals that the second of the six α-helices is lacking in VdesOBP1. Ligand-binding experiments revealed molecules able to bind only specific OBPs with a moderate affinity, suggesting that either optimal ligands have still to be identified, or post-translational modifications present in the native proteins may be essential for modulating binding activity, or else these OBPs might represent a failed attempt in evolution and are not used by the mites.']","['Amigues, Beatrice, [Zhu, Jiao], [Gaubert, Anais], [Arena, Simona], [Renzone, Giovanni], [Leone, Philippe], [Fischer, Isabella Maria], [Paulsen, Harald], [Knoll, Wolfgang], [Scaloni, Andrea], [Roussel, Alain], [Cambillau, Christian], [Pelosi, Paolo]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],[''],['A new non-classical fold of varroa odorant-binding proteins reveals a wide open internal cavity']

Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence.

Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001).

"['Background An epitope, Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R, termed α-gal, is present in glycoconjugates of New World monkeys (platyrrhines) and other mammals but not in hominoids and Old World monkeys (catarrhines). The difference is due to the inactivation of α1-3 galactosyl transferase (α1-3 GT) genes in catarrhines. Natural antibodies to α-gal are therefore developed in catarrhines but not platyrrhines and other mammals. Hypersensitivity reactions are commonly elicited by mosquito and tick vector bites. IgE antibodies against α-gal cause food allergy to red meat in persons who have been exposed to tick bites. Three enzymes synthesising the terminal α1-3-linked galactose in α-gal, that are homologous to mammalian α and β1-4 GTs but not mammalian α1-3 GTs, were recently identified in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis . IgG and IgM antibodies to α-gal are reported to protect against malaria because mosquito-derived sporozoites of malaria parasites express α-gal on their surface. This article explores the possibility that the α-gal in sporozoites are acquired from glycoconjugates synthesised by mosquitoes rather than through de novo synthesis by sporozoites. Methods The presence of proteins homologous to the three identified tick α1-3 GTs and mammalian α1-3 GTs in two important mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae , as well as Plasmodium malaria parasites, was investigated by BLASTp analysis to help clarify the source of the α-gal on sporozoite surfaces. Results Anopheles gambiae and Ae. aegypti possessed several different proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with α1-3 GT activity, but not mammalian α1-3 GTs. The putative mosquito α1-3 GTs possessed conserved protein domains characteristic of glycosyl transferases. However, the genus Plasmodium lacked proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with α1-3 GT activity and mammalian α1-3 GTs. Conclusions The putative α1-3 GTs identified in the two mosquito vectors may synthesise glycoconjugates containing α-gal that can be transferred to sporozoite surfaces before they are inoculated into skin during blood feeding. The findings merit further investigation because of their implications for immunity against malaria, hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, primate evolution, and proposals for immunisation against α-gal.

Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

Yet, the structural and functional requirements to promote the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Utilising in silico and in vitro methods, we here map the conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD) and provide first insights into its structure and function. By focusing on iRhom2, we identified different structural and functional factors within the IRHD. We found that the structural integrity of the IRHD is a key factor for ADAM17 binding. In addition, we identified a highly conserved motif within an unstructured region of the IRHD, that, when mutated, restricts the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex through the secretory pathway in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo systems and also increases the half-life of iRhom2 and ADAM17. Furthermore, the disruption of this IRHD motif was also reflected by changes in the yet undescribed interaction profile of iRhom2 with proteins involved in intracellular vesicle transport. Overall, we provide the first insights into the forward trafficking of iRhoms which is critical for TNFα and EGF receptor signalling.']","['Düsterhöft, Stefan, [Kahveci-Türköz, Selcan], [Wozniak, Justyna], [Seifert, Anke], [Kasparek, Petr], [Ohm, Henrike], [Liu, Shixin], [Kopkanova, Jana], [Lokau, Juliane], [Garbers, Christoph], [Preisinger, Christian], [Sedlacek, Radislav], [Freeman, Matthew], [Ludwig, Andreas]']",['10.1007/s00018-021-03845-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-021-03845-3'],[''],['The iRhom homology domain is indispensable for ADAM17-mediated TNFα and EGF receptor ligand release']
"['Plants are very susceptible to pathogens and every year, 25% of crop loss is caused by various types of pathogens including viruses. Many different strategies are being used for developing resistance against virus infection, including RNA silencing, and the genome editing including CRISPR-Cas-9 but these may produce variants/recombinants and could cause the problems for future crops. Another promising approach named as genome recoding or rewriting would be a better potential tool for controlling viral infections in plants. It relies on the concepts of replacement of synonymous codons, change in codon bias, codon pair bias and dinucleotide content. Recoding of the genome does not alter the amino acid sequences but it affects the expression level and translation efficiency. In the present report, the concept of synonymous codons, the basics of genome recoding and the possible strategies to generate genome recoded organisms are provided in details. Viral attenuation has been achieved by consideration of dinucleotide bias and codon pair bias manipulations and used in the synthesis of vaccines against various types of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The idea of the future scope of genome recoding for developing virus-resistant plants and their challenges for the same are also comprehensively discussed. Although genome recoding is not yet tested on plants, however it could be very helpful in controlling plant viral diseases.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Punica granatum red peel and Acacia saligna leaf extracts on Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus GST activity in order to reduce the resistance of cattle to acaricide. The results showed that P. granatum ethanol extract (70%) contained the highest total phenol content (350\u2009±\u20091.2\xa0μM GAE g −1 ), the highest condensed tannin content (270\u2009±\u20091.3\xa0μM CE g −1 ) and the highest hydrolysable tannin content (70\u2009±\u20095.0\xa0μM TAE g −1 ).

"['Background Relapsing fever (RF) borreliae are arthropod-borne spirochetes and some of them cause human diseases, which are characterized by relapsing or recurring episodes of fever. Recently, it has been classified into two groups: soft tick-borne RF (STRF) borreliae and hard tick-borne RF (HTRF) borreliae. STRF borreliae include classical RF agents and HTRF borreliae, the latter of which include B. miyamotoi , a human pathogen recently identified in Eurasia and North America. Results In this study, we determined the genome sequences of 16 HTRF borreliae strains: 15 B. miyamotoi strains (9 from Hokkaido Island, Japan, 3 from Honshu Island, Japan, and 3 from Mongolia) and a Borrelia sp. tHM16w. Chromosomal gene synteny was highly conserved among the HTRF strains sequenced in this study, even though they were isolated from different geographic regions and different tick species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sequences revealed that HTRF and STRF borreliae are clearly distinguishable, with each forming a monophyletic group in the RF borreliae lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary relationships of RF borreliae are consistent with the biological and ecological features of each RF borreliae sublineage and can explain the unique characteristics of Borrelia anserina . In addition, the pairwise genetic distances between HTRF borreliae strains were well correlated with those of vector species rather than with the geographical distances between strain isolation sites. This result suggests that the genetic diversification of HTRF borreliae is attributed to the speciation of vector ticks and that this relationship might be required for efficient transmission of HTRF borreliae within vector ticks. Conclusions The results of the present study, together with those from previous investigations, support the hypothesis that the common ancestor of borreliae was transmitted by hard-bodied ticks and that only STRF borreliae switched to using soft-bodied ticks as a vector, which was followed by the emergence of Borrelia recurrentis , lice-borne RF borreliae. Our study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships between RF borreliae, and the data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of RF borreliae.']","['Nakao, Ranna, [Kasama, Kentaro], [Boldbaatar, Bazartseren], [Ogura, Yoshitoshi], [Kawabata, Hiroki], [Toyoda, Atsushi], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Maeda, Ken]']",['10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],[''],['The evolution of hard tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae is correlated with vector species rather than geographical distance']

"['Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii , which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus . Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii -infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii -infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']
"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n \u2009=\u200929), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n \u2009=\u20096), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n \u2009=\u200914) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n \u2009=\u200917) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

Although online reviews represent a rich source of user information, they have rarely been used in determining the risk of tick exposure during recreational trail use. Based on online user reviews and comments, the purpose of this study was to determine risk factors and behavioral recommendations associated with tick encounters ( Tick Presence ) on recreational trails in the state of Indiana, U.S. Methods We reviewed 26,016 user comments left on AllTrails.com for 697 Indiana trails. Reviews were evaluated to determine Tick Presence/Absence , the total number of Tick Presence Reviews per trail, and multiple trail and user behavioral characteristics. We used hot spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis to test the hypothesis of whether there are clusters in the number of Tick Presence Reviews . Pearson chi-square tests of independence evaluated whether tick presence was associated with several trail characteristics. Finally, negative binomial regression evaluated the strength of the association between the number of Tick Presence Reviews and several trail characteristics. Results Tick Presence was recorded at 10% ( n \u2009=\u200965) of trails and occurred most frequently in May.

"['Elasticity analysis is a key tool in the analysis of matrix population models, which describe the dynamics of stage-structured populations in ecology and evolution. Elasticities of the dominant eigenvalue of a matrix model to matrix entries obey certain symmetries. Yet not all consequences of these symmetries are fully appreciated, as they are sometimes hidden in mathematical detail. Here, we propose a method to reason about these symmetries directly by visual inspection of the life cycle graph that corresponds to the matrix model. We present two applications of this method, one in ecology and one in evolution. First, we prove several conjectures about elasticities that were obtained from purely numerical results and that can support population managers in decision-making under scarce demographic information. Second, we show how to identify candidates for invariant trade-offs in evolutionary optimal life cycles. The method extends to the elasticity analysis of non-dominant eigenvalues, of the stochastic growth rate and, in next-generation matrices, of the basic reproduction number.']","['Giaimo, Stefano, [Traulsen, Arne]']",['10.1007/s12080-021-00513-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-021-00513-x'],[''],['Applying symmetries of elasticities in matrix population models']
"['Despite its clinical importance, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains unresolved, hindering dissection of COVID-19 biology. We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Background Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current indoor vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis . Methods The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus , and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control . Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function. Results All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68–73%.

"['Fusarium graminearum is a major fungal pathogen affecting crops of worldwide importance. F. graminearum produces type B trichothecene mycotoxins (TCTB), which are not fully eliminated during food and feed processing. Therefore, the best way to minimize TCTB contamination is to develop prevention strategies. Herein we show that treatment with the reduced form of the γ-core of the tick defensin DefMT3, referred to as TickCore3 (TC3), decreases F. graminearum growth and abrogates TCTB production. The oxidized form of TC3 loses antifungal activity, but retains anti-mycotoxin activity. Molecular dynamics show that TC3 is recruited by specific membrane phospholipids in F. graminearum and that membrane binding of the oxidized form of TC3 is unstable. Capping each of the three cysteine residues of TC3 with methyl groups reduces its inhibitory efficacy. Substitutions of the positively-charged residues lysine (Lys) 6 or arginine 7 by threonine had the highest and the lesser impact, respectively, on the anti-mycotoxin activity of TC3. We conclude that the binding of linear TC3 to F. graminearum membrane phospholipids is required for the antifungal activity of the reduced peptide.

In this study we have investigated the temporal gene expression across the 6 stages/sexes (egg, larvae, protonymph and deutonymph, adult male and adult female) of this neglected parasite in order to understand the temporal expression associated with development, parasitic lifestyle, reproduction and allergen expression. Results RNA-seq transcript data for the 6 stages were mapped to the PRM genome creating a publicly available gene expression atlas (on the OrcAE platform in conjunction with the PRM genome). Network analysis and clustering of stage-enriched gene expression in PRM resulted in 17 superclusters with stage-specific or multi-stage expression profiles. The 6 stage specific superclusters were clearly demarked from each other and the adult female supercluster contained the most stage specific transcripts (2725), whilst the protonymph supercluster the fewest (165). Fifteen pairwise comparisons performed between the different stages resulted in a total of 6025 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) ( P \u2009>\u20090.99). These data were evaluated alongside a Venn/Euler analysis of the top 100 most abundant genes in each stage. An expanded set of cuticle proteins and enzymes (chitinase and metallocarboxypeptidases) were identified in larvae and underpin cuticle formation and ecdysis to the protonymph stage. Two mucin/peritrophic-A salivary proteins (DEGAL6771g00070, DEGAL6824g00220) were highly expressed in the blood-feeding stages, indicating peritrophic membrane formation during feeding. Reproduction-associated vitellogenins were the most abundant transcripts in adult females whilst, in adult males, an expanded set of serine and cysteine proteinases and an epididymal protein (DEGAL6668g00010) were highly abundant. Assessment of the expression patterns of putative homologues of 32 allergen groups from house dust mites indicated a bias in their expression towards the non-feeding larval stage of PRM. Conclusions This study is the first evaluation of temporal gene expression across all stages of PRM and has provided insight into developmental, feeding, reproduction and survival strategies employed by this mite.

In addition, we investigated the pathogens that the ticks carry ( Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Rickettsia sp. and Babesia sp.) by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We collected a total of 875 ticks from the ground and from various animals and kept them at 4\xa0°C until experiments.

"['Objective To analyze the levels of high mobility group box\xa01 (HMGB1) protein on different courses of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods In our prospective longitudinal study, children with JIA were included with their blood samples collected at the first visit, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, respectively. Samples were also collected from healthy controls and children with reactive arthritis at the first visit. Levels of HMGB1 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Clinical disease characteristics and routine laboratory findings were analyzed as well. Results A total of 64 children were enrolled, of whom 31 (48.4%) were female. The median age at the first visit for participants with JIA was 9.25\u2009years (range, 1.42–15.42) and the median duration of disease was 2.38\u2009months (range, 1.53–49.31). Serum HMGB1 levels at the first visit were significantly elevated in children with systemic JIA compared with other groups, and so were in enthesitis-related arthritis versus healthy controls. Significant correlations were established at the first visit between HMGB1 levels and duration of disease, C-reactive protein, percentage of neutrophils, and ferritin. Data from all samples revealed that serum HMGB1 levels in JIA were significantly associated with erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, percentage of neutrophils, and disease activity scores. Conclusions Serum HMGB1 may be associated with clinical disease activity of JIA and specifically increased at the first visit in children with systemic JIA, suggesting its function as a sensitive inflammatory marker.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum . This study provides crucial information for ungulate management as a tool to mitigate zoonotic disease risk and argues for adapting management approaches to the local ungulate species composition and the pathogen(s) of concern.

"['Introduction COVID-19 long-haulers, also decribed as having “long-COVID” or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, represent 10% of COVID-19 patients and remain understudied. Methods In this prospective study, we recruited 30 consecutive patients seeking medical help for persistent symptoms (>\u200930\xa0days) attributed to COVID-19. All reported a viral illness compatible with COVID-19. The patients underwent a multi-modal evaluation, including clinical, psychologic, virologic and specific immunologic assays and were followed longitudinally. A group of 17 convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms were included as a comparison group. Results The median age was 40 [interquartile range: 35–54] years and 18 (60%) were female. At a median time of 152 [102–164] days after symptom onset, fever, cough and dyspnea were less frequently reported compared with the initial presentation, but paresthesia and burning pain emerged in 18 (60%) and 13 (43%) patients, respectively. The clinical examination was unremarkable in all patients, although the median fatigue and pain visual analog scales were 7 [5–8] and 5 [2–6], respectively. Extensive biologic studies were unremarkable, and multiplex cytokines and ultra-sensitive interferon-α2 measurements were similar between long-haulers and convalescent COVID-19 individuals without persistent symptoms. Using SARS-CoV-2 serology and IFN-γ ELISPOT, we found evidence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in 50% (15/30) of patients, with evidence of a lack of immune response, or a waning immune response, in two patients. Finally, psychiatric evaluation showed that 11 (36.7%), 13 (43.3%) and 9 (30%) patients had a positive screening for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Conclusions Half of patients seeking medical help for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome lack SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, or not, had no consequence on the clinical or biologic characteristics of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome patients, all of whom reported severe fatigue, altered quality of life and psychologic distress.']","['Scherlinger, Marc, [Felten, Renaud], [Gallais, Floriane], [Nazon, Charlotte], [Chatelus, Emmanuel], [Pijnenburg, Luc], [Mengin, Amaury], [Gras, Adrien], [Vidailhet, Pierre], [Arnould-Michel, Rachel], [Bibi-Triki, Sabrina], [Carapito, Raphaël], [Trouillet-Assant, Sophie], [Perret, Magali], [Belot, Alexandre], [Bahram, Seiamak], [Arnaud, Laurent], [Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric], [Fafi-Kremer, Samira], [Sibilia, Jean]']",['10.1007/s40121-021-00484-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40121-021-00484-w'],[''],['Refining “Long-COVID” by a Prospective Multimodal Evaluation of Patients with Long-Term Symptoms Attributed to SARS-CoV-2 Infection']

However, drugs that combat microbial infections can become a human health threat due to their high and often indiscriminate consumption, considered one of the factors of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emergence. The AMR crisis, the decrease in new drug development by the pharmaceutical industry, and reduced economic incentives for research have all reduced the options for treating infections, and new strategies are necessary, including the return of some traditional but “forgotten” antibiotics. However, prescriptions for these older drugs including nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin, have been based on the results of pioneer studies, and the limited knowledge generated 50–70 years ago may not be enough. To avoid harming patients and further increasing multidrug resistance, systematic evaluation is required, mainly for the drugs prescribed for community-acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTI). Therefore, this review has the objective of reporting the use of two classic drugs from the nitrofuran and phosphonic acid classes for UTI control nowadays.

"['Objective To approach the clinical value of MRI with vessel wall imaging (VWI) in patients with central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV), we analyzed patterns of VWI findings both at the time of initial presentation and during follow-up. Methods Stenoocclusive lesions, vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) and diffusion-restricted lesions were analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of CNSV. On available VWI follow-up, progression, regression or stability of VW-CE were evaluated and correlated with the clinical status. Results Of the 45 patients included, 28 exhibited stenoses visible on MR angiography (MRA-positive) while 17 had no stenosis (MRA-negative). VW-CE was found in 2/17 MRA-negative and all MRA-positive patients ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). 79.1% (53/67) of stenoses showed VW-CE. VW-CE was concentric in 88.3% and eccentric in 11.7% of cases. Diffusion-restricted lesions were found more frequently in relation to stenoses with VW-CE than without VW-CE ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). 48 VW-CE lesions in 23 patients were followed over a median time of 239.5\xa0days. 13 VW-CE lesions (27.1%) resolved completely, 14 (29.2%) showed partial regression, 17 (35.4%) remained stable and 4 (8.3%) progressed. 22/23 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for the duration of follow-up. Patients with stable or progressive VW-CE were more likely ( p \u2009<\u20090.05) to have a relapse (14/30 cases) than patients with partial or complete regression of VW-CE (5/25 cases). Conclusion Concentric VW-CE is a common finding in medium/large-sized vessel CNSV. VW-CE might represent active inflammation in certain situations.

This study recorded cortical auditory evoked potentials from younger to middle-aged (<\u200965\xa0years) and older (≥\u200965\xa0years) cochlear-implant (CI) listeners to assess age-related changes in temporal processing, where cochlear processing is bypassed in this population. Aging effects were compared to age-matched normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Advancing age was associated with prolonged P2 latencies in both CI and NH listeners in response to a 1000-Hz tone or a syllable /da/, and with prolonged N1 latencies in CI listeners in response to the syllable. Advancing age was associated with larger N1 amplitudes in NH listeners. These age-related changes in latency and amplitude were independent of stimulus presentation rate. Further, CI listeners exhibited prolonged N1 and P2 latencies and smaller P2 amplitudes than NH listeners. Thus, aging appears to degrade some aspects of auditory temporal processing when peripheral-cochlear contributions are largely removed, suggesting that changes beyond the cochlea may contribute to age-related temporal processing deficits.']","['Xie, Zilong, [Stakhovskaya, Olga], [Goupell, Matthew J.], [Anderson, Samira]']",['10.1007/s10162-021-00804-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10162-021-00804-4'],[''],['Aging Effects on Cortical Responses to Tones and Speech in Adult Cochlear-Implant Users']
"['Infectious agents can trigger autoimmune responses in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. Lyme arthritis, which is caused by the tick-transmitted spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi , is effectively treated in most patients with antibiotic therapy; however, in a subset of patients, arthritis can persist and worsen after the spirochaete has been killed (known as post-infectious Lyme arthritis). This Review details the current understanding of the pathogenetic events in Lyme arthritis, from initial infection in the skin, through infection of the joints, to post-infectious chronic inflammatory arthritis. The central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is an excessive, dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response during the infection phase that persists into the post-infectious period. This response is characterized by high amounts of IFNγ and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The consequences of this dysregulated pro-inflammatory response in the synovium include impaired tissue repair, vascular damage, autoimmune and cytotoxic processes, and fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. These synovial characteristics are similar to those in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, post-infectious Lyme arthritis provides a model for other chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory arthritides in which complex immune responses can be triggered and shaped by an infectious agent in concert with host genetic factors. Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of Lyme disease, can sometimes persist in a chronic post-infectious disease. In this Review, the authors argue that post-infectious Lyme arthritis could act as a model to improve understanding of other forms of chronic arthritis. A combination of spirochaetal and host genetic factors shape the outcome of Lyme arthritis, which ranges from mild, antibiotic-responsive joint inflammation to persistent, antibiotic-refractory autoinflammatory or autoimmune synovitis. Certain highly inflammatory strains of Borrelia burgdorferi most commonly found in north-eastern USA are present at an increased frequency among patients who subsequently develop post-infectious Lyme arthritis. The histology of post-infectious Lyme arthritis synovia is similar to that in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis, but there is greater microvascular damage in Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi is no longer present in synovia after treatment with antibiotics, but B. burgdorferi peptidoglycan might persist and could be an important promoter of innate immune responses. Dysregulated, excessive IFNγ responses and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are a central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis, and contribute to persistent inflammation and the development of autoimmunity. Synovial fibroblasts, the most common cell in the synovial lesion, become immune effector cells capable of altering the innate and adaptive immune microenvironment in Lyme arthritis.']","['Lochhead, Robert B., [Strle, Klemen], [Arvikar, Sheila L.], [Weis, Janis J.], [Steere, Allen C.]']",['10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],[''],"['Lyme arthritis: linking infection, inflammation and autoimmunity']"
"['Infectious agents, including viruses and bacteria, are proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to this hypothesis, these agents have capacity to evade the host immune system leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and subsequent deposition of Aβ and phosphorylated-tau in the brain. Co-existing proteinopathies and age-related pathologies are common in AD and the brains of elderly individuals, but whether these are also related to neuroinfections remain to be established. This study determined the prevalence and distribution of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in patients with infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis ( n \u2009=\u200913) and neurosyphilis ( n \u2009=\u200923).

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. These new findings pave the way for the development of new strategies for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.

"['Background Malaria is a major health problem in Ethiopia. Sleeping under long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is its major control strategy. Despite high LLINs use (84%) in Ziway-Dugda District, malaria remained a public health problem, raising concern on its effectiveness. Understanding the effectiveness of malaria control interventions is vital. This study evaluated the effectiveness of LLINs and determinants of malaria in Ziway-Dugda District, Arsi Zone Ethiopia. Methods A matched case–control study was conducted among 284 study participants (71 cases and 213 controls) in Ziway-Dugda District, Arsi Zone, Ethiopia from March to May, 2017. Three health centers were selected randomly, and enrolled individuals newly diagnosed for malaria proportionally. Cases and controls were individuals testing positive and negative for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests. Each case was matched to three controls using the age of (5\xa0years), gender and village of residence. The information was collected using pre-tested structured questionnaires through face to face interviews and observation. Data were entered into Epi-Info version 3.5, and analysed using Stata version-12 . Conditional logistic regression was performed, and odds of LLINs use were compared using matched Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of\u2009<\u20090.05. Results One hundred twenty-three (61.2%) of the controls and 22 (32.8%) of cases had regularly slept under LLINs in the past two weeks. Using multivariate analysis, sleeping under LLINs for the past two weeks (AOR\u2009=\u20090.23, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.11–0.45); living in houses sprayed with indoor residual spray (IRS) (AOR\u2009=\u20090.23, 95%CI: 0.10–0.52); and staying late outdoors at night in the past two-weeks (AOR\u2009=\u20092.99, 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.44–6.19) were determinant factors. Conclusions Sleeping under LLINs is effective for malaria prevention in the district. IRS and staying late outdoors at night were determinants of malaria. It is recommended to increase attention on strengthening LLINs use and IRS in the area.']","['Wubishet, Mesfin Kelkile, [Berhe, Gebretsadik], [Adissu, Alefech], [Tafa, Mesfin Segni]']",['10.1186/s12936-021-03833-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03833-9'],[''],"['Effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets in prevention of malaria among individuals visiting health centres in Ziway-Dugda District, Ethiopia: matched case–control study']"

Initially, the MRI input images are fed to preprocessing steps. Then, the image segmentation is carried out by fuzzy-c means (FCM) clustering for identifying the tumor region. These tumor and non-tumor images undergo a feature extraction process utilizing principle component analysis (PCA), mean, entropy, and wavelet transform. The obtained feature vector is fed to the RBNN layer. It needs an optimal CC, which can be considered by using the newly proposed IWOA. RBNN classifies the abnormality of the brain into brain tumor, inflammatory disease, stroke, and degenerative. Its performance is tested on three datasets.

"['Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m 2 ) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m 2 ) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.']","['Hansford, Kayleigh M., [McGinley, Liz], [Wilkinson, Samantha], [Gillingham, Emma L.], [Cull, Ben], [Gandy, Sara], [Carter, Daniel P.], [Vaux, Alexander G.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s). These results demonstrate that, with limited data size for model training, a simple shallow custom-built CNN model has great prospects for use in the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Saeedpour-Parizi, Mohammad R.], [Rahman, Md.

"['Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

"['Pediatric use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the Netherlands is highly prevalent. The risks of pediatric CAM use are, however, largely unknown. Therefore, a 3-year survey was carried out at the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Pediatricians were asked to register cases of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage. In 3 years, 32 unique adverse events were registered. Twenty-two of these adverse events were indirect and not related to the specific CAM therapy but due to delaying, changing, or stopping of regular treatment, a deficient or very restrictive diet or an incorrect diagnosis by a CAM therapist. These events were associated with many different CAM therapies. Nine events were deemed direct adverse events like bodily harm or toxicity and one-third of them occurred in infants. Only supplements, manual therapies, and (Chinese) herbs were involved in these nine events. In one case, there was a risk of a serious adverse event but harm had not yet occurred. Conclusion : Relatively few cases of adverse events associated with pediatric CAM usage were found, mostly due to delaying or stopping conventional treatment. Nevertheless, parents, pediatricians and CAM providers should be vigilant for both direct and indirect adverse events in children using CAM, especially in infants. What’s Known: • The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in children is common. • Previous surveillance studies in other countries showed severe adverse events may occur after pediatric CAM usage. What is New: • In the Netherlands CAM-related adverse events are rare but can occur, with variable etiology and severity (from mild to potentially life-threatening) • Most CAM-related adverse events are not directly the result of CAM toxicities but rather are associated with withdrawal from appropriate therapies or with providers unable to recognize health-relevant states and delaying important diagnoses.']","['Vos, Björn, [Rake, Jan Peter], [Vlieger, Arine]']",['10.1007/s00431-020-03899-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03899-8'],[''],['Adverse events associated with pediatric complementary and alternative medicine in the Netherlands: a national surveillance study']
"['Purpose of Review This article presents a comprehensive narrative review of reactive arthritis (ReA) with focus on articles published between 2018 and 2020. We discuss the entire spectrum of microbial agents known to be the main causative agents of ReA, those reported to be rare infective agents, and those reported to be new candidates causing the disease. The discussion is set within the context of changing disease terminology, definition, and classification over time. Further, we include reports that present at least a hint of effective antimicrobial therapy for ReA as documented in case reports or in double-blind controlled studies. Additional information is included on microbial products detected in the joint, as well as on the positivity of HLA-B27. Recent Findings Recent reports of ReA cover several rare causative microorganism such as Neisseria meningitides , Clostridium difficile , Escherichia coli , Hafnia alvei , Blastocytosis , Giardia lamblia , Cryptosporidium , Cyclospora cayetanensis , Entamoeba histolytica/dispar , Strongyloides stercoralis , β-haemolytic Streptococci , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin, and Rickettsia rickettsii. The most prominent new infectious agents implicated as causative in ReA are Staphylococcus lugdunensis , placenta- and umbilical cord–derived Wharton’s jelly, Rothia mucilaginosa , and most importantly the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Summary In view of the increasingly large spectrum of causative agents, diagnostic consideration for the disease must include the entire panel of post-infectious arthritides termed ReA. Diagnostic procedures cannot be restricted to the well-known HLA-B27-associated group of ReA, but must also cover the large number of rare forms of arthritis following infections and vaccinations, as well as those elicited by the newly identified members of the ReA group summarized herein. Inclusion of these newly identified etiologic agents must necessitate increased research into the pathogenic mechanisms variously involved, which will engender important insights for treatment and management of ReA.']","['Zeidler, Henning, [Hudson, Alan P.]']",['10.1007/s11926-021-01018-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11926-021-01018-6'],[''],['Reactive Arthritis Update: Spotlight on New and Rare Infectious Agents Implicated as Pathogens']
"['COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

"['Pathogens continue to emerge from increased contact with novel host species. Whilst these hosts can represent distinct environments for pathogens, the impacts of host genetic background on how a pathogen evolves post-emergence are unclear. In a novel interaction, we experimentally evolved a pathogen ( Staphylococcus aureus ) in populations of wild nematodes ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) to test whether host genotype and genetic diversity affect pathogen evolution. After ten rounds of selection, we found that pathogen virulence evolved to vary across host genotypes, with differences in host metal ion acquisition detected as a possible driver of increased host exploitation. Diverse host populations selected for the highest levels of pathogen virulence, but infectivity was constrained, unlike in host monocultures. We hypothesise that population heterogeneity might pool together individuals that contribute disproportionately to the spread of infection or to enhanced virulence. The genomes of evolved populations were sequenced, and it was revealed that pathogens selected in distantly-related host genotypes diverged more than those in closely-related host genotypes. S. aureus nevertheless maintained a broad host range.

Patients and methods The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings. Results Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients). Conclusion White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population.

To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses. This study provides the groundwork for assessing stress tolerance in this bipolar ectoparasite.']","['Davies, Benjamin, [Rosendale, Andrew J.], [Gantz, Josiah D.], [Lee, Richard E., Jr.], [Denlinger, David L.], [Benoit, Joshua B.]']",['10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02887-4'],[''],"['Cross-tolerance and transcriptional shifts underlying abiotic stress in the seabird tick, Ixodes uriae']"
"['Background H3K27M-mutant midline lesions were recently reclassified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “diffuse midline glioma” (DMG) based entirely on their molecular signature. DMG is one of the most common and most lethal pediatric brain tumors; terminal progression is typically caused by local midbrain or brainstem progression, or secondary leptomeningeal dissemination. H3K27M mutations have also been infrequently associated with a histologically and prognostically diverse set of lesions, particularly spinal masses with early leptomeningeal spread. Case presentation A 15-year-old girl after 1\xa0week of symptoms was found to have a T2/FLAIR-hyperintense and contrast-enhancing thalamic mass accompanied by leptomeningeal enhancement along the entire neuraxis. Initial infectious workup was negative, and intracranial biopsy was inconclusive. Spinal arachnoid biopsy revealed an H3K27M-mutant lesion with glioneuronal features, classified thereafter as DMG. She received craniospinal irradiation with a boost to the thalamic lesion. Imaging 1-month post-radiation demonstrated significant treatment response with residual enhancement at the conus. Conclusions This case report describes the unique presentation of an H3K27M-mutant midline lesion with significant craniospinal leptomeningeal spread on admission and atypical glioneuronal histopathological markers. With such florid leptomeningeal disease, spinal dural biopsy should be considered earlier given its diagnostic yield in classifying the lesion as DMG. Consistent with similar prior reports, this lesion additionally demonstrated synaptophysin positivity—also potentially consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT). In atypical DMG cases, particularly with leptomeningeal spread, further consideration of clinical and histopathological context is necessary for accurate diagnosis and prognostication.']","['Navarro, Ralph E., [Golub, Danielle], [Hill, Travis], [McQuinn, Michelle W.], [William, Christopher], [Zagzag, David], [Hidalgo, Eveline Teresa]']",['10.1007/s00381-020-04892-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00381-020-04892-0'],[''],['Pediatric midline H3K27M-mutant tumor with disseminated leptomeningeal disease and glioneuronal features: case report and literature review']
"['The goal of sentence matching is to determine the semantic relation between two sentences, which is the basis of many downstream tasks in natural language processing, such as question answering and information retrieval. Recent studies using attention mechanism to align the elements of two sentences have shown promising results in capturing semantic similarity/relevance. Most existing methods mainly focus on the design of multi-layer attention network, however, some critical issues have not been dealt with well: 1) the higher attention layer is easily affected by error propagation because it relies on the alignment results of preceding attentions; 2) models have the risk of losing low-layer semantic features with the increase of network depth; and 3) the approach of capturing global matching information brings about large computing complexity for model training. To this end, we propose a Deep Bi-Directional Interaction Network (DBDIN) to solve these issues, which captures semantic relatedness from two directions and each direction employs multiple attention-based interaction units. To be specific, the attention of each interaction unit will repeatedly focus on the original sentence representation of another one for semantic alignment, which alleviates the error propagation problem by attending to a fixed semantic representation. Then we design deep fusion to aggregate and propagate attention information from low layers to high layers, which effectively retains low-layer semantic features for subsequential interactions. Moreover, we introduce a self-attention mechanism at last to enhance global matching information with smaller model complexity. We conduct experiments on natural language inference and paraphrase identification tasks with three benchmark datasets SNLI, SciTail and Quora. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve significant improvements over baseline systems without using any external knowledge. Additionally, we conduct interpretable study to disclose how our deep interaction network with attention can benefit sentence matching, which provides a reference for future model design. Ablation studies and visualization analyses further verify that our model can better capture interactive information between two sentences, and the proposed components are indeed able to help modeling semantic relation more precisely.']","['Liu, Mingtong, [Zhang, Yujie], [Xu, Jinan], [Chen, Yufeng]']",['10.1007/s10489-020-02156-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02156-7'],[''],['Deep bi-directional interaction network for sentence matching']

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks.

There is a growing need to understand national trends in exposures and health outcomes associated with climate change and the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies for health. To date, most indicators for health implications of climate change have been designed as independent, individual metrics. This approach fails to take into account how exposure-outcome pathways for climate-attributable health outcomes involve multiple, interconnected components.

"['The composition of wildlife communities can have strong effects on transmission of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens, with more diverse communities often supporting lower infection prevalence in vectors (dilution effect). The introduced Burmese python, Python bivittatus , is eliminating large and medium-sized mammals throughout southern Florida, USA, impacting local communities and the ecology of zoonotic pathogens. We investigated invasive predator-mediated impacts on ecology of Everglades virus (EVEV), a zoonotic pathogen endemic to Florida that circulates in mosquito-rodent cycle. Using binomial generalized linear mixed effects models of field data at areas of high and low python densities, we show that increasing diversity of dilution host (non-rodent mammals) is associated with decreasing blood meals on amplifying hosts (cotton rats), and that increasing cotton rat host use is associated with increasing EVEV infection in vector mosquitoes. The Burmese python has caused a dramatic decrease in mammal diversity in southern Florida, which has shifted vector host use towards EVEV amplifying hosts (rodents), resulting in an indirect increase in EVEV infection prevalence in vector mosquitoes, putatively elevating human transmission risk. Our results indicate that an invasive predator can impact wildlife communities in ways that indirectly affect human health, highlighting the need for conserving biological diversity and natural communities. Burkett-Cadena et al. use a combination of field survey methods, citizen science data, and molecular analysis to determine how the invasive Burmese python distribution affects mammal host use and virus infection by vector mosquitoes.

"['Over the past several decades the dramatic increase in the availability of computational resources, coupled with the maturation of machine learning, has profoundly impacted sensor technology. In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to ‘lock-in’ to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from ‘big data’ analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others. Traditional sensing techniques apply computational analysis at the output of the sensor hardware to separate signal from noise.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']
"['Purpose of Review Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health challenge. This review aims to summarize the incidence, risk factors, possible pathophysiology, and proposed management of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-PASC based on the published literature. Recent Findings The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. Summary With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments. Awareness among the general population and health care professionals about PASC is rising, and more efforts are needed to understand and treat this new emerging challenge.

"['Infectious agents can trigger autoimmune responses in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. Lyme arthritis, which is caused by the tick-transmitted spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi , is effectively treated in most patients with antibiotic therapy; however, in a subset of patients, arthritis can persist and worsen after the spirochaete has been killed (known as post-infectious Lyme arthritis). This Review details the current understanding of the pathogenetic events in Lyme arthritis, from initial infection in the skin, through infection of the joints, to post-infectious chronic inflammatory arthritis. The central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is an excessive, dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response during the infection phase that persists into the post-infectious period. This response is characterized by high amounts of IFNγ and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The consequences of this dysregulated pro-inflammatory response in the synovium include impaired tissue repair, vascular damage, autoimmune and cytotoxic processes, and fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. These synovial characteristics are similar to those in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, post-infectious Lyme arthritis provides a model for other chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory arthritides in which complex immune responses can be triggered and shaped by an infectious agent in concert with host genetic factors. Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of Lyme disease, can sometimes persist in a chronic post-infectious disease. In this Review, the authors argue that post-infectious Lyme arthritis could act as a model to improve understanding of other forms of chronic arthritis. A combination of spirochaetal and host genetic factors shape the outcome of Lyme arthritis, which ranges from mild, antibiotic-responsive joint inflammation to persistent, antibiotic-refractory autoinflammatory or autoimmune synovitis. Certain highly inflammatory strains of Borrelia burgdorferi most commonly found in north-eastern USA are present at an increased frequency among patients who subsequently develop post-infectious Lyme arthritis. The histology of post-infectious Lyme arthritis synovia is similar to that in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis, but there is greater microvascular damage in Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi is no longer present in synovia after treatment with antibiotics, but B. burgdorferi peptidoglycan might persist and could be an important promoter of innate immune responses. Dysregulated, excessive IFNγ responses and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are a central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis, and contribute to persistent inflammation and the development of autoimmunity. Synovial fibroblasts, the most common cell in the synovial lesion, become immune effector cells capable of altering the innate and adaptive immune microenvironment in Lyme arthritis.']","['Lochhead, Robert B., [Strle, Klemen], [Arvikar, Sheila L.], [Weis, Janis J.], [Steere, Allen C.]']",['10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00648-5'],[''],"['Lyme arthritis: linking infection, inflammation and autoimmunity']"

With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence.

"['We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species.']","['Adams, Ben, [Walter, Katharine S], [Diuk-Wasser, Maria A.]']",['10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00896-2'],[''],"['Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains']"

By contrast, ionic strength did not have an effect on binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16. Of relevance, plasminogen bound to the borrelial protein cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2251 upon conversion by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPa), demonstrating it retained its physiological activity. Interestingly, further analyses revealed a complement inhibitory activity of Vlp15/16 and Vlp18 on the alternative pathway by a Factor H-independent mechanism.

"['Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK–STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host. Borrelia burgdorferi has a complex life cycle with several different hosts, causing Lyme disease when it infects humans.

Twenty genospecies compose Bbsl currently, and with the exception of Borrelia chilensis , and Borrelia garinii , all have been described only for North America, Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Here, we collected specimens of Ixodes paranaensis , a tick associated with swifts in a Brazilian natural park from the state of Minas Gerais, and performed a molecular characterization of 11 borrelial genes.

We used the double robust approach of stabilized inverse probability weighting and propensity score adjustment to obtain ORs. Approximately 5% of participants (n\u2009=\u2009142) self-reported TBD diagnosis. Practicing different PPMs ranged from 48% for treating outdoor clothing with special bug-spray to 83% for walking on established trails.

In stratified analyses, TBD knowledge, safety worry because of ticks, avoiding outdoors because of ticks, and pet TBD risk modified the associations between different PPMs and self-reported TBD diagnosis. In the state of Indiana, thorough body/clothes check after being outdoors and use of insect repellent on exposed skin might be strongly effective in preventing TBD. The protective effect of different PPMs might be stronger among people with high TBD knowledge, high safety worry because of ticks, high avoidance of being outdoors because of ticks, and low pet TBD risk.

"['Background Impact of climate change on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle in a given region depends on how the region-specific climate change patterns influence tick population development processes and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission dynamics involving both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes. Predicting the transmission risk of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with projected climate conditions is essential for planning public health interventions including vaccination programs to mitigate the TBE incidence in the inhabitants and travelers. We have previously developed and validated a mathematical model for retroactive analysis of weather fluctuation on TBE prevalence in Hungary, and we aim to show in this research that this model provides an effective tool for projecting TBEV transmission risk in the enzootic cycle. Methods Using the established model of TBEV transmission and the climate predictions of the Vas county in western Hungary in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, we quantify the risk of TBEV transmission using a series of summative indices - the basic reproduction number, the duration of infestation, the stage-specific tick densities, and the accumulated (tick) infections due to co-feeding transmission. We also measure the significance of co-feeding transmission by observing the cumulative number of new transmissions through the non-systemic transmission route. Results The transmission potential and the risk in the study site are expected to increase along with the increase of the temperature in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. This increase will be facilitated by the expected extension of the tick questing season and the increase of the numbers of susceptible ticks (larval and nymphal) and the number of infected nymphal ticks co-feeding on the same hosts, leading to compounded increase of infections through the non-systemic transmission. Conclusions The developed mathematical model provides an effective tool for predicting TBE prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle, by integrating climate projection with emerging knowledge about the region-specific tick ecological and pathogen enzootic processes (through model parametrization fitting to historical data). Model projects increasing co-feeding transmission and prevalence of TBEV in a recognized TBE endemic region, so human risk of TBEV infection is likely increasing unless public health interventions are enhanced.']","['Nah, Kyeongah, [Bede-Fazekas, Ákos], [Trájer, Attila János], [Wu, Jianhong]']",['10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],[''],['The potential impact of climate change on the transmission risk of tick-borne encephalitis in Hungary']

Furthermore, mixed infections with multiple microorganisms further complicate and limit the detection potential of traditional diagnostic methods. The present study investigated the tick-borne microorganisms in bovine ticks in Pakistan, employing a high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR based technique. Methods Ticks were collected from clinically healthy cattle ( n \xa0=\xa0116) and water buffaloes ( n \xa0=\xa088) from 30 villages across six districts located in five agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Pakistan from September to November 2017. The microfluidic real-time PCR was used to test the genomic DNA of individual ticks for the presence of 27 bacterial and eight parasitic microorganisms. Phylogenetic methods were used to assess the genetic relationship of DNA sequences determined herein. Results PCR detected DNA of at least one microorganism in each of 221 ticks tested (94.4%, 221/234). DNA-based detection inferred that single pathogens/endosymbionts were the most common (43.4%, 96/221) followed by double (38.9%, 86/221), triple (14.5%, 32/221), quadruple (2.3%, 5/221) and quintuple (0.9%, 2/221) mixed infections. Piroplasms ( Babesia / Theileria spp.) were the most prevalent (31.6%, 74/234), followed by Ehrlichia spp. (20%, 47/234) and Anaplasma marginale (7.7%, 18/234). Anaplasma phagocytophilum , A. ovis , A. centrale , Babesia ovis , Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., R. massiliae , Bartonella spp. and Hepatozoon spp. were also detected. Endosymbionts such as Francisella -like (91.5%, 214/234) and Coxiella -like (1.3%, 3/234) organisms were also detected in ticks. The highest diversity of microorganisms was detected in Hyalomma anatolicum ticks (test-positive for 14/14 microorganisms), followed by Rhipicephalus microplus (4/14), Hy. hussaini (3/14) and Rh. annulatus (2/14).

All available structures from the genus Borrelia represent proteins expressed without a membrane-targeting signal peptide, thus avoiding conserved pathways that modify, fold and assemble membrane protein complexes. Towards elucidating structure and function of these critical proteins, we directed translocation of eleven expression-optimized Bb virulence factors, including the signal sequence, to the Escherichia coli membrane, of which five, BBA57, HtrA, BB0238, BB0323, and DipA, were expressed with C-terminal His-tags.

Previous studies showed multiple critical roles of BBA57 in transmission, joint arthritis, carditis, weakening immune responses, and regulating other Bb outer surface proteins.

"['Background The evolutionary history of a species is frequently derived from molecular sequences, and the resulting phylogenetic trees do not include explicit functional information. Here, we aimed to assess the functional relationships among bacteria in the Spirochaetes phylum, based on the biological processes of 42,489 proteins in reference proteomes of 34 Spirochaetes species. We tested the hypothesis that the species in the genus Borrelia might be sufficiently different to warrant splitting them into two separate genera. Results A detrended canonical analysis demonstrated that the presence/absence of biological processes among selected bacteria contained a strong phylogenetic signal, which did not separate species of Borrelia . We examined the ten biological processes in which most proteins were involved consistently. This analysis demonstrated that species in Borrelia were more similar to each other than to free-life species ( Sediminispirochaeta , Spirochaeta , Sphaerochaeta ) or to pathogenic species without vectors ( Leptospira , Treponema, Brachyspira ), which are highly divergent. A dendrogram based on the presence/absence of proteins in the reference proteomes demonstrated that distances between species of the same genus among free-life or pathogenic non-vector species were higher than the distances between the 19 species (27 strains) of Borrelia . A phyloproteomic network supported the close functional association between species of Borrelia . In the proteome of 27 strains of Borrelia , only a few proteins had evolved separately, in the relapsing fever and Lyme borreliosis groups. The most prominent Borrelia proteins and processes were a subset of those also found in free-living and non-vectored pathogenic species. In addition, the functional innovation (i.e., unique biological processes or proteins) of Borrelia was very low, compared to other genera of Spirochaetes. Conclusions We found only marginal functional differences among Borrelia species. Phyloproteomic networks that included all pairwise combinations between species, proteins, and processes were more effective than other methods for evaluating the evolutionary relationships among taxa.

"['Background Borrelia sp. is a causative pathogen of Lyme disease which has become a worldwide health concern. Non-toxic approaches especially directed toward latent persistent forms of this pathogen are desired. Lipids in the form of volatile and non-volatile oils, and fatty acids with proven anti-borreliae efficacy could become an additional support or an alternative for consideration in treatment approaches. Methods In this study we investigated 47 lipids (30 volatile and non-volatile oils, and 17 fatty acids) of plant and animal origin against typical motile, knob/round-shaped persisters, and biofilm-like aggregates of Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. and Borrelia garinii , which are identified as pathogenic factors of Lyme disease in the USA and Europe, using direct microscopic counting and spectrofluorometric measurements. Results Out of all examined lipids, 5 oils (Bay leaf oil, Birch oil, Cassia oil, Chamomile oil German, and Thyme oil) at or below 0.25%, and 3 fatty acids (13Z,16Z Docosadienoic acid, erucic acid, and petroselinic acid) at or below 0.75\u2009mg/ml, showed bactericidal activity against typical motile spirochetes and knob/round-shaped persisters. Only Bay leaf oil and Cassia oil, including their major constituents, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, showed to target biofilm-like aggregates of both tested Borrelia spp. at the same concentration , although with 20–30% eradication mark. Conclusion Based on obtained results, volatile oils were more potent than non-volatile oils, and unsaturated fatty acids were more effective than saturated fatty acids.

"['Background With approximately one-third of their genomes consisting of linear and circular plasmids, the Lyme disease agent cluster of species has the most complex genomes among known bacteria. We report here a comparative analysis of plasmids in eleven Borreliella (also known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) species. Results We sequenced the complete genomes of two B. afzelii, two B. garinii, and individual B. spielmanii , B. bissettiae, B. valaisiana and B. finlandensis isolates. These individual isolates carry between seven and sixteen plasmids, and together harbor 99 plasmids. We report here a comparative analysis of these plasmids, along with 70 additional Borreliella plasmids available in the public sequence databases. We identify only one new putative plasmid compatibility type (the 30th) among these 169 plasmid sequences, suggesting that all or nearly all such types have now been discovered. We find that the linear plasmids in the non- B. burgdorferi species have undergone the same kinds of apparently random, chaotic rearrangements mediated by non-homologous recombination that we previously discovered in B. burgdorferi . These rearrangements occurred independently in the different species lineages, and they, along with an expanded chromosomal phylogeny reported here, allow the identification of several whole plasmid transfer events among these species. Phylogenetic analyses of the plasmid partition genes show that a majority of the plasmid compatibility types arose early, most likely before separation of the Lyme agent Borreliella and relapsing fever Borrelia clades, and this, with occasional cross species plasmid transfers, has resulted in few if any species-specific or geographic region-specific Borreliella plasmid types. Conclusions The primordial origin and persistent maintenance of the Borreliella plasmid types support their functional indispensability as well as evolutionary roles in facilitating genome diversity. The improved resolution of Borreliella plasmid phylogeny based on conserved partition-gene clusters will lead to better determination of gene orthology which is essential for prediction of biological function, and it will provide a basis for inferring detailed evolutionary mechanisms of Borreliella genomic variability including homologous gene and plasmid exchanges as well as non-homologous rearrangements.']","['Casjens, Sherwood R., [Di, Lia], [Akther, Saymon], [Mongodin, Emmanuel F.], [Luft, Benjamin J.], [Schutzer, Steven E.], [Fraser, Claire M.], [Qiu, Wei-Gang]']",['10.1186/s12864-018-4597-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4597-x'],[''],['Primordial origin and diversification of plasmids in Lyme disease agent bacteria']

The aim of the study was to evaluate main tick-borne disease risk factors in natural, endemic areas of north-east (NE) Poland (Białowieża) and urban areas of central Poland (Warsaw), measuring tick abundance/density, prevalence of infection with spirochaetes and diversity of these pathogens in spring-early summer and late summer-autumn periods between 2012 and 2015. Methods Questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from three urban sites in Warsaw, central Poland and three natural sites in Białowieża, NE Poland. A total of 2993 ticks were analyzed for the presence of Borreliella spp. and/or Borrelia miyamotoi DNA by PCR. Tick abundance was analyzed by General Linear Models (GLM). Prevalence and distribution of spirochaetes was analyzed by Maximum Likelihood techniques based on log-linear analysis of contingency tables (HILOGLINEAR).

Prevalence of spirochaetes was significantly higher in the summer-autumn period than in the spring-early summer [15.0% (95% CI: 12.8–17.5%) vs 10.4% (95% CI: 9.2–11.6%), respectively]. We have detected six species of bacteria present in both types of areas, with different frequencies: dominance of B. afzelii (69.3%) in urban and B. garinii (48.1%) in natural areas. Although we observed higher tick densities in forests than in maintained parks, the prevalence of spirochaetes was significantly higher in the latter [9.8% (95% CI: 8.6–11.0%) vs 17.5% (95% CI: 14.4–20.5%)]. Conclusions Surprisingly, a similar risk of infection with Borreliella spp. and/or B. miyamotoi was discovered in highly- and low-transformed areas.

"['The causal agents of Lyme disease in North America, Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii , are transmitted primarily by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Due to their limited metabolic capacity, spirochetes rely on the tick blood meal for nutrients and metabolic intermediates while residing in the tick vector, competing with the tick for nutrients in the blood meal. Metabolomics is an effective methodology to explore dynamics of spirochete survival and multiplication in tick vectors before transmission to a vertebrate host via tick saliva. Using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified statistically significant differences in the metabolic profile among uninfected I. scapularis nymphal ticks, B. burgdorferi -infected nymphal ticks and B. mayonii -infected nymphal ticks by measuring metabolism every 24\u2009hours over the course of their up to 96\u2009hour blood meals. Specifically, differences in the abundance of purines, amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids during the blood meal among the three groups of nymphal ticks suggest that B. mayonii and B. burgdorferi may have different metabolic capabilities, especially during later stages of nymphal feeding.

"['Background The Ehrlichia muris -like agent (EMLA) is a newly recognized human pathogen in the North Central United States. Although blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) have been identified as capable vectors, wild reservoirs have not yet been established for EMLA. As key hosts for I. scapularis , white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) are important reservoirs for various tick-borne pathogens, and potentially, for EMLA. The objective of this study was to evaluate reservoir competence in P. leucopus using a natural vector. Results Mice acquired EMLA infection from feeding ticks and were able to transmit infection to naïve ticks. Transmission between simultaneously feeding tick life stages was also demonstrated. Infections in mice were acute and severe, with systemic dissemination. Limited host survival and clearance of infection among survivors resulted in a narrow interval where EMLA could be acquired by feeding ticks. Conclusions Peromyscus leucopus is a competent reservoir of EMLA and likely to play a role in its enzootic transmission cycle. The duration and severity of EMLA infection in these hosts suggests that tick phenology is a critical factor determining the geographic distribution of EMLA in North America.']","['Lynn, Geoffrey E., [Oliver, Jonathan D.], [Cornax, Ingrid], [O’Sullivan, M.

We show that attacks were caused by yearling wolves (13-month-old male and 14-month-old female) originating from local packs, which appeared near households several months prior to incidents. Both individuals were positively food-conditioned and showed increasing habituation caused by irresponsible behaviour of people such as long-lasting intentional feeding or illegal keeping. Post mortem necropsy revealed obesity and serious abnormality of spleen (polysplenia) in the problem female wolf that negatively impacted her fitness and was the most likely reason for her presence near households and feeding on leftovers.

"['Abstract The extent to which host group size affects the hosts’ exposure to parasites and pathogens has been explored by behavioral ecologists for almost 50\xa0years, and we know that host and parasite taxa, mobility of host and parasite, and the extent of spatial structure within groups all affect the group-size relationship. Here we examine how the prevalence of an arthropod-borne viral pathogen changes with host group size in a host-parasite system recently invaded by an introduced species that also serves as a host for the virus. Infection by the alphavirus, Buggy Creek virus (BCRV), in swallow bugs ( Cimex vicarius ) increased with colony size of the cliff swallow ( Petrochelidon pyrrhonota ; the bugs’ principal host) in the absence of invasive house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) but decreased with swallow colony size in the presence of sparrows. The sparrow-adapted lineage A of BCRV declined to near extinction in the largest cliff swallow colonies, regardless of sparrow presence. The results may reflect BCRV’s divergence into a lineage (B) that amplifies mostly in bugs and thus is transmitted more effectively in large cliff swallow colonies that maintain high numbers of the blood-feeding bugs, whereas the other lineage (A) is adapted to house sparrows and does not require large numbers of bugs and cliff swallows for effective transmission and persistence. The results show that an alternative host can modify the group-size consequences for the original host and illustrate another complexity in analyzing the costs and benefits of coloniality whenever invasive species are present. Significance statement Predicting the spread of viral pathogens can be important in assessing threats to wildlife or humans, and the size of a host’s social group is regarded as a potentially important determinant of pathogen exposure. Invasive species can sometimes profoundly alter disease dynamics when they enter a host-parasite system and serve as alternative hosts, thereby either increasing or decreasing the original host’s exposure to pathogens. For an arthropod-borne virus that is vectored by a blood-feeding bug that parasitizes a colonially breeding bird, we found that virus infection in bugs increased with host (bird) group size when an invasive bird species was absent but decreased with host group size when the invasive was present. The study indicates that the presence of alternative hosts is another variable to consider in trying to predict how pathogen exposure is affected by host group size.']","['Moore, Amy T., [O’Brien, Valerie A.], [Brown, Charles R.]']",['10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-03040-1'],[''],['Group-size effects on virus prevalence depend on the presence of an invasive species']
"['Orexin (hypocretin), is a neuropeptide produced by a subset of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. From the lateral hypothalamus, the orexin-containing neurons project their fibres extensively to other brain structures, and the spinal cord constituting the central orexinergic system. Generally, the term ‘’orexinergic system’’ usually refers to the orexin peptides and their receptors, as well as to the orexin neurons and their projections to different parts of the central nervous system. The extensive networks of orexin axonal fibres and their terminals allow these neuropeptidergic neurons to exert great influence on their target regions. The hypothalamic neurons containing the orexin neuropeptides have been implicated in diverse functions, especially related to the control of a variety of homeostatic functions including feeding behaviour, arousal, wakefulness stability and energy expenditure. The broad range of functions regulated by the orexinergic system has led to its description as ‘’physiological integrator’’. In the last two decades, the orexinergic system has been a topic of great interest to the scientific community with many reports in the public domain. From the documentations, variations exist in the neuroanatomical profile of the orexinergic neuron soma, fibres and their receptors from animal to animal. Hence, this review highlights the distinct variabilities in the morphophysiological aspects of the orexinergic system in the vertebrate animals, mammals and non-mammals, its presence in other brain-related structures, including its involvement in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.

"['Background Malaria control primarily depends on two vector control strategies: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Both IRS and LLIN target indoor-biting mosquitoes. However, some of the most important malaria vectors have developed resistance against the chemical compounds used in IRS and LLINs. Insecticide-induced behavioural changes in vectors, such as increased outdoor feeding on cattle and other animals, also limit the effectiveness of these strategies. Novel vector control strategies must therefore be found to complement IRS and LLINs. A promising tool is the use of cattle-applied endectocides. Endectocides are broad-spectrum systemic drugs that are effective against a range of internal nematodes parasites and blood-feeding arthropods. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two endectocide drugs, injectable ivermectin and topical fipronil, on the survival and fecundity of zoophilic Anopheles arabiensis. Methods Laboratory-reared mosquitoes were allowed to feed on cattle treated with either injectable ivermectin (0.2\xa0mg/kg), topical fipronil (1.0\xa0mg/kg) or saline (control) on days 0, 1, 4, 7, 13, 21 and 25 post-treatment, and mortality and egg production were recorded daily. Results Compared to controls, the mortality of An. arabiensis increased by 3.52- and 2.43-fold with injectable ivermectin and topical fipronil, respectively. The overall fecundity of mosquitoes that fed on both ivermectin- and fipronil-treated cattle was significantly reduced by up to 90 and 60%, respectively, compared to the control group. The effects of both drugs attenuated over a period of 3\xa0weeks. Injectable ivermectin was more effective than topical fipronil and increased mosquito mortality by a risk factor of 1.51 higher than fipronil. Similarly, both drugs significantly reduced the fecundity of An. arabiensis . Conclusions This study demonstrates that injectable ivermectin and topical fipronil are able to suppress An. arabiensis density and could help to reduce outdoor malaria transmission. Data from the present study as well as from other similar studies suggest that current-generation endectocides have a limited duration of action and are expensive. However, new-generation, sustained-release formulations of ivermectin have a multi-week, high mortality impact on vector populations, thus holding promise of an effective reduction of outdoor malaria transmission.

To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed.

Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies.

"['Invasive alien species (IAS) can act as vectors for the introduction of pathogens in ecosystems and their transmission to threatened native species (TNS), leading to biodiversity loss, population reductions and extinctions. We assessed pathogens potentially occurring in a set of IAS in the Southern Cone of South America and identified TNS potentially vulnerable to their effects. Also, we assessed how risk analysis systems proposed or adopted by national authorities in the study region value the importance of pathogens. We identified 324 pathogens in the selected IAS, which could potentially affect 202 TNS. Wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) was the IAS with the largest number of pathogens (91), followed by domestic dog ( Canis familiaris ) (62), red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) (58), rock dove ( Columba livia ) (37), American vison ( Neovison vison ) (18), European hare ( Lepus europaeus ) (17), common starling ( Sturnus vulgaris ) (12), common slider ( Trachemys scripta ) (6), and American bullfrog ( Lithobates catesbeianus ) (2). Most TNS were in the “vulnerable” IUCN category, followed by “endangered” and “critically endangered” species. Bacteria were the most frequently represented pathogens (112), followed by ectoparasites (78), viruses (69), protozoa and other (65). The direct effects of IAS on native wildlife are beginning to be addressed in South America, and their potential impact as pathogen spreaders to native wildlife has remained largely unexplored. Risk analysis systems associated with the introduction of IAS are scarce in this region. Although the existing systems contemplate hazard analyses for the co-introduction of pathogens, they underestimate the potential impact of diseases on TNS.

"['Background Birds are major hosts for many tick species (Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and their role is especially important in transporting ticks over large distances along their seasonal migratory routes. Accordingly, most studies across Europe focus on the importance of avian hosts in tick dispersal, and less emphasis is laid on resident birds and their role in supporting tick life cycles. Eurasian eagle owls ( Bubo bubo ) exemplify the latter, but all the few studies on their tick infestation were carried out in Western Europe and even those did not involve a large sample size and did not assess infestation prevalence in natural habitats. Methods In this study, 320 ixodid ticks were collected from nestlings of Eurasian eagle owls during the period 2018–2020 in Bulgaria in south-eastern Europe. These ticks were analysed morphologically, and selected specimens molecularly based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( cox 1) gene. The effects of environmental and habitat-related conditions and of the species of prey eaten by eagle owls on tick infestation were also evaluated. Results The majority of ticks were identified as adults of Rhipicephalus turanicus ( n \u2009=\u2009296). In addition, 15 Hyalomma marginatum (three males, 11 nymphs and a larva), one female of Haemaphysalis erinacei and of Ha. punctata , and a nymph of Ixodes ricinus were found. Among R. turanicus , two distinct morphotypes were observed, but they do not form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial gene cox1. We found a positive correlation between the total number of ticks on nestlings from a particular nest and the number of medium-sized to large prey mammals brought to the nestling owls. Also, the most important predictor for tick abundance was the effect of the extent of arable land (negative), while forests and grasslands contributed less, with no effect observed in case of urbanized areas and watercourses. Conclusions The intensity of tick infestation can be high on nestling Eurasian eagle owls (mean intensity 16.59\xa0ticks/nestling). In this study, five different tick species were recorded, among which R. turanicus dominated. Two male morphotypes of this tick species were found, but their morphological differences were not reflected by genetic diversity or phylogenetic clustering. The most important factor determining tick abundance was the land-use structure.

"['High infection risk is often associated with aggregations of animals around attractive resources. Here, we explore the behavior of potential hosts of non-trophically transmitted parasites at mesocarnivore carcass sites. We used videos recorded by camera traps at 56 red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) carcasses and 10 carcasses of other wild carnivore species in three areas of southeastern Spain. Scavenging species, especially wild canids, mustelids and viverrids, showed more frequent rubbing behavior at carcass sites than non-scavenging and domestic species, suggesting that they could be exposed to a higher potential infection risk. The red fox was the species that most frequently contacted carcasses and marked and rubbed carcass sites. Foxes contacted heterospecific carcasses more frequently and earlier than conspecific ones and, when close contact occurred, it was more likely to be observed at heterospecific carcasses. This suggests that foxes avoid contact with the type of carcass and time period that have the greatest risk as a source of parasites. Overall, non-trophic behaviors of higher infection risk were mainly associated with visitor-carcass contact and visitor contact with feces and urine, rather than direct contact between visitors. Moreover, contact events between scavengers and carnivore carcasses were far more frequent than consumption events, which suggests that scavenger behavior is more constrained by the risk of acquiring meat-borne parasites than non-trophically transmitted parasites. This study contributes to filling key gaps in understanding the role of carrion in the landscape of disgust, which may be especially relevant in the current global context of emerging and re-emerging pathogens.

"['In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape.']","['Conte, Christine E., [Leahy, Jessica E.], [Gardner, Allison M.]']",['10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],[''],['Active Forest Management Reduces Blacklegged Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Exposure Risk']
"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18\xa0mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.

"['Purpose The present research was taken to study the hospital-based incidence and clinico-pathological changes associated with naturally occurring trypanosomosis in dogs of Mizoram. Methods A 5-year prospective study on hospital-based incidence and clinico-pathological changes associated with naturally occurring trypanosomosis in dogs of Mizoram was carried out during the study period from April, 2015 to March, 2020. Trypanosoma evansi infection was confirmed by microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Non-infected clinically healthy dogs ( n \u2009=\u20096) served as control. Blood samples were collected to study the haemogram and serum samples were used for the evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and oxidant-antioxidant parameters . Results During the study period, an overall incidence of 0.25% was recorded for trypanosomosis in dogs. The most consistent clinical findings noticed were anorexia/inappetence, pyrexia, depression/lethargy, pale mucous membrane, dehydration and lymphadenomegaly. Anaemia, granulocytopenia, lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia were the major findings noticed in trypanosomosis affected dogs. The profile of vital organ function revealed that the mean values of total protein, albumin and random blood glucose were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower, whereas the mean values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher in dogs affected with trypanosomosis. The mean value of lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) was significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher, whereas the mean values of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant activity (TAOA) were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower in trypanosomosis affected dogs. When total erythrocyte count (TEC) was correlated with LPO ( r \u2009=\u2009−\xa00.631, P \u2009<\u20090.05), a negative correlation was found, while in case of GSH ( r \u2009=\u20090.757, P \u2009<\u20090.05), SOD ( r \u2009=\u20090.767, P \u2009<\u20090.05) and TAOA ( r \u2009=\u20090.713, P \u2009<\u20090.05), it was positively correlated. Conclusion A negative correlation of TEC count with LPO, while a positive correlation with GSH, SOD and TAOA signify the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of anaemia induced by T. evansi infection in dogs. The present study findings might be helpful to clinicians when treating clinical cases of this kind.

"['Background Improved knowledge on vector-borne pathogens in wildlife will help determine their effect on host species at the population and individual level and whether these are affected by anthropogenic factors such as global climate change and landscape changes. Here, samples from brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea ) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA ( n \u2009=\u200917), SHNA ( n \u2009=\u200919) and SHTZ ( n \u2009=\u200925) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau -like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum / platys -like and Anaplasma bovis -like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau -like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli -like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis -like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1–4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2–4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0–4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia , multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group. Ecological conditions explained pathogen identity and diversity better than host taxonomy.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05).

"['Background Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) associated to ticks are among the most important health issues affecting dogs. In Italy, Ehrlichia canis , Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia conorii and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) have been studied in both healthy canine populations and those clinically ill with suspected CVBDs. However, little information is currently available on the overall prevalence and distribution of these pathogens in the country. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and distribution of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in clinically suspect dogs from three Italian macro areas during a 15-year period (2006–2020). Methods A large dataset ( n \u2009=\u200921,992) of serological test results for selected TBPs in three macro areas in Italy was analysed using a Chi-square test to evaluate the associations between the categorical factors (i.e. macro area, region, year, sex and age) and a standard logistic regression model (significance set at P \u2009=\u20090.05). Serological data were presented as annual and cumulative prevalence, and distribution maps of cumulative positive cases for TBPs were generated. Results Of the tested serum samples, 86.9% originated from northern (43.9%) and central (43%) Italy. The majority of the tests was requested for the diagnosis of E. canis (47%; n \u2009=\u200910,334), followed by Rickettsia spp. (35.1%; n \u2009=\u20097725), B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (11.6%; n \u2009=\u20092560) and Anaplasma spp. (6.2%; n \u2009=\u20091373). The highest serological exposure was recorded for B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (83.5%), followed by Rickettsia spp. (64.9%), Anaplasma spp. (39.8%) and E. canis (28.7%). The highest number of cumulative cases of Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was recorded in samples from Tuscany, central Italy. Rickettsia spp. was more prevalent in the south and on the islands, particularly in dogs on Sicily older than 6\xa0years, whereas Anaplasma spp. was more prevalent in the north and E. canis more prevalent in the south and on the islands. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the high seroprevalence and wide distribution of the four TBPs in dogs with clinically suspected CVBDs from the studied regions of Italy. The very high seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) exemplifies a limitation of this study, given the use of clinically suspect dogs and the possibility of cross-reactions when using serological tests. The present research provides updated and illustrative information on the seroprevalence and distribution of four key TBPs, and advocates for integrative control strategies for their prevention.

Based on phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA Coxiella genotypes identified in this study grouped in strongly supported monophyletic clades with identified reference sequences of CLEs detected from Rhipicephalus , Dermacentor , Haemaphysalis and Ornithodoros species and with Coxiella burnetii strains isolated worldwide. Conclusion This study reports the molecular detection of a high diversity of Coxiella- like bacteria in Sardinian ticks and confirms also the presence of C. burnetii in tick species previously identified in the island. The role that Coxiella -like endosymbionts play in Sardinian ticks and in their vertebrate hosts needs to be explored further.']","['Chisu, Valentina, [Mura, Lorena], [Foxi, Cipriano], [Masala, Giovanna]']",['10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],[''],"['Coxiellaceae in Ticks from Human, Domestic and Wild Hosts from Sardinia, Italy: High Diversity of Coxiella-like Endosymbionts']"
"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']
"['Ticks will diminish productivity among farm animals and transmit zoonotic diseases. We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%).

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']

There is minimal published data available to date on potential haematological and biochemical changes associated with this parasitic infection. Study aims were (i) provide an overview of A. reconditum in Europe, (ii) define A. reconditum prevalence and risk factors in a specific dog population (hunting) from southern Italy, and (iii) assess the frequency of haemato-biochemical abnormalities associated with infection. Blood samples collected from 3020 dogs were tested by a modified Knott’s technique to count and identify microfilariae. Eighty-four dogs were infected by A. reconditum (2.78%; 95% CI 2.19–3.37%). Microfilariae ranged from 1 to 212/ml. Based on clinical examination, all but six dogs with non-specific symptoms were healthy. Haematological abnormalities included leucocytosis ( n = 15), with eosinophilia ( n = 14) and monocytosis ( n = 13). Serum biochemical abnormalities included increased total serum proteins ( n = 19), albumins ( n = 7), total globulins ( n = 14), ALT ( n = 1), and ALP ( n = 1); one dog was hypoalbuminemic, and BUN was mildly increased in 2 dogs. Risk factors included the province origin (Napoli, OR=5.4, 95%CI: 2.1–14.0; Caserta, OR=5.1, 95%CI: 2.5–10.6), hunting wild mammals (OR=2.8, 95% 95%CI: 1.6–4.8), and ectoparasite infestation (OR=1.9, 95%CI: 1.1–3.1). There was a negative correlation between microfilaraemic load and decreased albumin level (−0.37; p =0.021).

"['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites (Arthropoda: Acari) is reviewed within a mechanical model. Trophic access (body size and cheliceral reach) and food morsel handling (chelal gape and estimated static adductive crushing force) are morphologically investigated. Forty-seven commonly occurring astigmatid mite species from 20 genera (covering the Acaridae, Aeroglyphidae, Carpoglyphidae, Chortoglyphidae, Glycyphagidae, Lardoglyphidae, Pyroglyphidae, Suidasiidae, and Winterschmidtiidae) are categorised into functional groups using heuristics. Conclusions are confirmed with statistical tests and multivariate morphometrics. Despite these saprophagous acarines in general being simple ‘shrunken/swollen’ versions of each other, clear statistical correlations in the specifics of their mechanical design (cheliceral and chelal scale and general shape) with the type of habitat and food consumed (their ‘biome’) are found. Using multivariate analyses, macro- and microsaprophagous subtypes are delineated. Relative ratios of sizes on their own are not highly informative of adaptive syndromes. Sympatric resource competition is examined. Evidence for a maximum doubling of approximate body volume within nominal taxa is detected but larger mites are not more ‘generalist’ feeding types. Two contrasting types of basic ‘Bauplan’ are found differing in general scale: (i) a large, chunk-crunching, ‘demolition’-feeding omnivore design (comprising 10 macrosaprophagous astigmatid species), and (ii) a small selective picking, squashing/slicing or fragmentary/‘plankton’ feeding design (which may indicate obligate fungivory/microbivory) comprising 20 microsaprophagous acarid-shaped species. Seventeen other species appear to be specialists. Eleven of these are either: small (interstitial/burrowing) omnivores—or a derived form designed for processing large hard food morsels (debris durophagy, typified by the pyroglyphid Dermatophagoides farinae ), or a specialist sub-type of particular surface gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeding. Six possible other minor specialist gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeders types each comprising one to two species are described. Details of these astigmatid trophic-processing functional groups need field validation and more corroborative comparative enzymology. Chelal velocity ratio in itself is not highly predictive of habitat but with cheliceral aspect ratio (or chelal adductive force) is indicative of life-style. Herbivores and pest species are typified by a predicted large chelal adductive force. Pest species may be ‘shredders’ derived from protein-seeking necrophages. Carpoglyphus lactis typifies a mite with tweezer-like chelae of very feeble adductive force. It is suggested that possible zoophagy (hypocarnivory) is associated with low chelal adductive force together with a small or large gape depending upon the size of the nematode being consumed. Kuzinia laevis typifies an oophagous durophage. Functional form is correlated with taxonomic position within the Astigmata—pyroglyphids and glycyphagids being distinct from acarids. A synthesis with mesostigmatid and oribatid feeding types is offered together with clarification of terminologies. The chelal lyrifissure in the daintiest chelicerae of these astigmatids is located similar to where the action of the chelal moveable digit folds the cheliceral shaft in uropodoids, suggesting mechanical similarities of function. Acarid astigmatids are trophically structured like microphytophagous/fragmentary feeding oribatids. Some larger astigmatids ( Aleuroglyphus ovatus , Kuzinia laevis , Tyroborus lini ) approximate, and Neosuidasia sp. matches, the design of macrophytophagous oribatids. Most astigmatid species reviewed appear to be positioned with other oribatid secondary decomposers. Only Dermatophagoides microceras might be a primary decomposer approximating a lichenivorous oribatid ( Austrachipteria sp.) in trophic form. Astigmatid differences are consilient with the morphological trend from micro- to macrophytophagy in oribatids. The key competency in these actinotrichid mites is a type of ‘gnathosomisation’ through increased chelal and cheliceral height (i.e., a shape change that adjusts the chelal input effort arm and input adductive force) unrestricted by the dorsal constraint of a mesostigmatid-like gnathotectum. A predictive nomogram for ecologists to use on field samples is included. Future work is proposed in detail.']","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00625-3'],[''],['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites']
"['As the 1951 Refugee Convention advances into its 70 th anniversary, there are mixed feelings as to whether it has lived up to its aspiration. For while it may be hailed as a significant force in the human rights arena (broadly construed), its narrow focus excludes millions who are constantly subjected to various forms of atrocities at the hands of their governments or third parties. Two major concerns to potential asylum seekers, refugee activists and human rights scholars have been the Convention’s conceptualisation of ‘refugee’ and its status determination processes. This duality is demonstrated in the exclusion of ‘disability’ from the international definition of ‘refugee’ and, more specifically, elimination of ‘albinism’ as a humanitarian imperative. Since children with albinism (CwA) are victims of or face constant threats of persecution and there is limited domestic safeguard, the paper argues that the UN Refugee Agency must partner with western countries in resettling these children and similarly situated persons. The focus on CwA is informed by their limited physical strength to ward off their attackers, thereby making them more vulnerable to abduction and related atrocities.

Adults were then morphologically identified using reference identification keys. A total of 20 breeding sites were productive out of an approximately 90 sites prospected. Water collections, pits, swamps and cinder blocks were main categories of larval habitats. In total, 2125 mosquito larvae were collected and reared during the survey. A total of 1790 mosquito adults emerged and were further identified and distributed among three genera: Culex (73.3%); Anopheles (22.6%) and Aedes (4.1%).

"['Transmembrane conductance of small uncharged solutes such as glycerol typically occurs through aquaglyceroporins (Glps), which are commonly encoded by multiple genes in metazoan organisms. To date, however, little is known concerning the evolution of Glps in Crustacea or what forces might underly such apparent gene redundancy. Here, we show that Glp evolution in Crustacea is highly divergent, ranging from single copy genes in species of pedunculate barnacles, tadpole shrimps, isopods, amphipods and decapods to up to 10 copies in diplostracan water fleas although with monophyletic origins in each lineage. By contrast the evolution of Glps in Copepoda appears to be polyphyletic, with surprisingly high rates of gene duplication occurring in a genera- and species-specific manner. Based upon functional experiments on the Glps from a parasitic copepod ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ), we show that such lineage-level gene duplication and splice variation is coupled with a high rate of neofunctionalization. In the case of L. salmonis , splice variation of a given gene resulted in tissue- or sex-specific expression of the channels, with each variant evolving unique sites for protein kinase C (PKC)- or protein kinase A (PKA)-regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking. The combined data sets thus reveal that mutations favouring a high fidelity control of intracellular trafficking regulation can be a selection force for the evolution and retention of multiple Glps in copepods. Marc Catalán-Garcia et al. examine evolutionary divergence of aquaglyceroporins (GLPs) in copepods, observing that these genes are subject to high rates of gene duplication across species. They also report tissue- and sex-specific expression of GLP splice variants in the parasitic copepod, L. salmonis, that in turn exhibit PKA- or PKC-dependent changes in membrane trafficking.

"['Developing general principles of host–microorganism interactions necessitates a robust understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes that structure microbiota. Phylosymbiosis, or patterns of microbiome composition that can be predicted by host phylogeny, is a unique framework for interrogating these processes. Identifying the contexts in which phylosymbiosis does and does not occur facilitates an evaluation of the relative importance of different ecological processes in shaping the microbial community. In this Review, we summarize the prevalence of phylosymbiosis across the animal kingdom on the basis of the current literature and explore the microbial community assembly processes and related host traits that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We find that phylosymbiosis is less prevalent in taxonomically richer microbiomes and hypothesize that this pattern is a result of increased stochasticity in the assembly of complex microbial communities. We also note that despite hosting rich microbiomes, mammals commonly exhibit phylosymbiosis. We hypothesize that this pattern is a result of a unique combination of mammalian traits, including viviparous birth, lactation and the co-evolution of haemochorial placentas and the eutherian immune system, which compound to ensure deterministic microbial community assembly. Examining both the individual and the combined importance of these traits in driving phylosymbiosis provides a new framework for research in this area moving forward. In this Review, Mallott and Amato summarize the prevalence of phylosymbiosis across the animal kingdom and explore the microbial community assembly processes and related host traits that contribute to phylosymbiosis.

However, the traditional motion recognition methods have the disadvantages such as low recognition rate, time-consuming due to the vast model parameters and edge artifacts, etc. By combining the shallow multi-scale network with the deep network, this paper proposes a novel sports motion image recognition based on a lightweight two-stream fusion deep neural network with the ResNet model. This model can greatly reduce the number of model parameters and improve the accuracy of feature extraction. Finally, we conduct the experiments on four public data sets: UCF101, HMDB51, MSR3D and UCF-Sport.

"['Background The emergence of tick-borne disease is increasing because of the effects of the temperature rise driven by global warming. In Turkey, 19 pathogens transmitted by ticks to humans and animals have been reported. Based on this, this study aimed to investigate tick-borne pathogens including Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., and Bartonella spp. in tick samples ( n = 110) collected from different hosts (dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and turtles) by molecular methods. Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected. Hepatozoon spp. was detected in R. sanguineus ticks while Theileria spp. , Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected in R. turanicus and H. marginatum . According to the results of sequence analyses applied for pathogen positive samples, Hepatozoon canis , Theileria ovis , Babesia caballi , and Anaplasma ovis were identified.

"['Background The significance of tick-borne diseases has increased considerably in recent years. Because of the unique distribution of the tick species Dermacentor reticulatus in Poland, comprising two expanding populations, Eastern and Western that are separated by a Dermacentor -free zone, it is important to conduct studies on the process of tick expansion and emergence of canine babesiosis. The main aim of the current study was to monitor the expansion of D. reticulatus populations from spring 2016 to autumn 2018 to determine (1) the actual geographical range of this tick species, and (2) and the seasonal/annual shift in range limits and changes in distance between Western and Eastern populations of ticks (the size of the non-endemic area). Methods Ticks were collected in spring/autumn during a 3-year study. From each season and year at least three pairs of sites from the Western and Eastern populations were selected. Then the mean distance between paired sites was calculated for each season and year. We collected and analyzed data from veterinary clinics on the number of canine babesiosis cases treated in the clinic during a whole year (2018). Results Accordingly, further expansion of the two D. reticulatus populations was recorded, mainly along river basins. Marked colonization of the gap zone was observed, with a mean annual shift in the range of 2.5–10 km and a steadily decreasing distance between the two tick populations. The occurrence of babesiosis in different regions revealed low numbers of cases in Western Poland (19 cases/year) and the gap area (only 7 cases/year) and high incidence (up to 250 cases/1000 dogs) and fatality (total 3.65%) in Central and Eastern Poland. Strong associations were found geographically between tick and babesiosis occurrence and temporally in the seasonal patterns of occurrence of ticks and outbreaks of babesiosis. Conclusions We documented the shift in range limits and continued process of colonization of the gap zone accompanied by the emergence of canine babesiosis in the Eastern expansion zone. Updated maps of the distribution of ticks and occurrence of babesiosis in different regions of Poland have allowed us to predict of the emergence of pathogens vectored by D. reticulatus.

"['Background Fragmented mitochondrial (mt) genomes and extensive mt gene rearrangements have been frequently reported from parasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera). However, relatively little is known about the mt genomes from the family Philopteridae, the most species-rich family within the suborder Ischnocera. Methods Herein, we use next-generation sequencing to decode the mt genome of Falcolipeurus suturalis and compare it with the mt genome of F. quadripustulatus . Phylogenetic relationships within the family Philopteridae were inferred from the concatenated 13 protein-coding genes of the two Falcolipeurus lice and members of the family Philopteridae using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Results The complete mt genome of F. suturalis is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule 16,659\xa0bp in size that contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and three non-coding regions. The gene order of the F. suturalis mt genome is rearranged relative to that of F. quadripustulatus , and is radically different from both other louse species and the putative ancestral insect. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clear genetic distinctiveness between F. suturalis and F. quadripustulatus (Bayesian posterior probabilities\u2009=\u20091.0 and bootstrapping frequencies\u2009=\u2009100), and that the genus Falcolipeurus is sister to the genus Ibidoecus (Bayesian posterior probabilities\u2009=\u20091.0 and bootstrapping frequencies\u2009=\u2009100).

"['Survival in a dynamic environment requires animals to plan future actions based on past sensory evidence, known as motor planning. However, the neuronal circuits underlying this crucial brain function remain elusive. Here, we employ projection-specific imaging and perturbation methods to investigate the direct pathway linking two key nodes in the motor planning network, the secondary motor cortex (M2) and the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), in mice performing a memory-dependent perceptual decision task. We find dynamic coding of choice information in SC-projecting M2 neurons during motor planning and execution, and disruption of this information by inhibiting M2 terminals in SC selectively impaired decision maintenance. Furthermore, we show that while both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons receive synaptic inputs from M2, these SC subpopulations display differential temporal patterns in choice coding during behavior. Our results reveal the dynamic recruitment of the premotor-collicular pathway as a circuit mechanism for motor planning.

After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks.

The remaining good quality spectra were then queried against the upgraded MALDI-TOF MS database, showing that 100% were in agreement with the morphological identification, with logarithmic score values (LSVs) between 1.813 and 2.51.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

Dogs living in the tropics are highly exposed to babesial parasites, particularly to Babesia vogeli . Limited data on the seroprevalence and molecular prevalence of Babesia spp. in dogs are available in Latin America. We conducted a cross-sectional study combining serological and molecular tests to estimate the seroprevalence and molecular epidemiology of Babesia spp. infections in dogs in two hyperendemic foci in Brazil. A total of 630 privately owned dogs (417 from Goiana municipality, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, and 213 from São Joaquim de Bicas municipality, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil) were sampled and molecularly and serologically tested for Babesia spp. Overall, 519 dogs (82.4%) presented detectable IgG antibodies against Babesia spp., and seropositivity was significantly higher in dogs older than 1\xa0year. Molecularly, 34 dogs (5.4%) were positive for a\u2009~\u2009200\xa0bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp. and 88 (14.0%) for a longer fragment (~\u2009450\xa0bp) of the same gene of Babesia spp. and other protozoa.

"['Endosymbiont transmission via eggs to future host generations has been recognized as the main strategy for its persistence in insect hosts; however, the mechanisms for transmission have yet to be elucidated. Here, we describe the dynamic locations of Rickettsia in the ovarioles and eggs during oogenesis and embryogenesis in a globally significant pest whitefly Bemisia tabaci . Field populations of the whitefly have a high prevalence of Rickettsia , and in all Rickettsia-infected individuals, the bacterium distributes in the body cavity of the host, especially in the midgut, fat body, hemocytes, hemolymph, and near bacteriocytes. The distribution of Rickettsia was subjected to dynamic changes in the ovary during oogenesis, and our ultrastructural observations indicated that the bacteria infect host ovarioles during early developmental stages via two routes: (i) invasion of the tropharium by endocytosis and then transmission into vitellarium via nutritive cord and (ii) entry into vitellarium by hijacking bacteriocyte translocation. Most of the Rickettsia are degraded in the oocyte cytoplasm in late-stage oogenesis. However, a few reside beneath the vitelline envelope of mature eggs, spread into the embryo, and proliferate during embryogenesis to sustain high-fidelity transmission to the next generation.

"['The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae , is a significant ectoparasite of penguins in Antarctica and of other seabirds, mainly in coastal, polar regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but the tick’s distribution extends into more temperate regions as well. The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

"['Background Birds are major hosts for many tick species (Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and their role is especially important in transporting ticks over large distances along their seasonal migratory routes. Accordingly, most studies across Europe focus on the importance of avian hosts in tick dispersal, and less emphasis is laid on resident birds and their role in supporting tick life cycles. Eurasian eagle owls ( Bubo bubo ) exemplify the latter, but all the few studies on their tick infestation were carried out in Western Europe and even those did not involve a large sample size and did not assess infestation prevalence in natural habitats. Methods In this study, 320 ixodid ticks were collected from nestlings of Eurasian eagle owls during the period 2018–2020 in Bulgaria in south-eastern Europe. These ticks were analysed morphologically, and selected specimens molecularly based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( cox 1) gene. The effects of environmental and habitat-related conditions and of the species of prey eaten by eagle owls on tick infestation were also evaluated. Results The majority of ticks were identified as adults of Rhipicephalus turanicus ( n \u2009=\u2009296). In addition, 15 Hyalomma marginatum (three males, 11 nymphs and a larva), one female of Haemaphysalis erinacei and of Ha. punctata , and a nymph of Ixodes ricinus were found. Among R. turanicus , two distinct morphotypes were observed, but they do not form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial gene cox1. We found a positive correlation between the total number of ticks on nestlings from a particular nest and the number of medium-sized to large prey mammals brought to the nestling owls. Also, the most important predictor for tick abundance was the effect of the extent of arable land (negative), while forests and grasslands contributed less, with no effect observed in case of urbanized areas and watercourses. Conclusions The intensity of tick infestation can be high on nestling Eurasian eagle owls (mean intensity 16.59\xa0ticks/nestling). In this study, five different tick species were recorded, among which R. turanicus dominated. Two male morphotypes of this tick species were found, but their morphological differences were not reflected by genetic diversity or phylogenetic clustering. The most important factor determining tick abundance was the land-use structure.

"['Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), as they occur in insects, form a distinct class of proteins that apparently has no closely related representatives in other animals. However, ticks, mites, spiders and millipedes contain genes encoding proteins with sequence similarity to insect OBPs. In this work, we have explored the structure and function of such non-insect OBPs in the mite Varroa destructor , a major pest of honey bee. Varroa OBPs present six cysteines paired into three disulphide bridges, but with positions in the sequence and connections different from those of their insect counterparts. VdesOBP1 structure was determined in two closely related crystal forms and appears to be a monomer. Its structure assembles five α-helices linked by three disulphide bridges, one of them exhibiting a different connection as compared to their insect counterparts. Comparison with classical OBPs reveals that the second of the six α-helices is lacking in VdesOBP1. Ligand-binding experiments revealed molecules able to bind only specific OBPs with a moderate affinity, suggesting that either optimal ligands have still to be identified, or post-translational modifications present in the native proteins may be essential for modulating binding activity, or else these OBPs might represent a failed attempt in evolution and are not used by the mites.']","['Amigues, Beatrice, [Zhu, Jiao], [Gaubert, Anais], [Arena, Simona], [Renzone, Giovanni], [Leone, Philippe], [Fischer, Isabella Maria], [Paulsen, Harald], [Knoll, Wolfgang], [Scaloni, Andrea], [Roussel, Alain], [Cambillau, Christian], [Pelosi, Paolo]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],[''],['A new non-classical fold of varroa odorant-binding proteins reveals a wide open internal cavity']
"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18\xa0mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults.

Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum / platys -like and Anaplasma bovis -like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ.

"['Background Haemaphysalis longicornis is an obligate hematophagous ectoparasite that transmits a variety of pathogens causing life-threatening diseases in humans and animals. Paramyosin (Pmy) is not only an invertebrate-specific myofibrillar protein but also an important immunomodulatory protein. Therefore, it is one of the ideal candidate antigens for vaccines. Methods We conducted two vaccine trials to evaluate the protective efficacy of Pmy recombinant protein (rPmy) and peptide vaccine (KLH-LEE). Each rabbit was immunized with three doses of rPmy or KLH-LEE adjuvanted with Freund’s complete/incomplete at 500\xa0μg/dose at 2-week intervals before challenge with 40 female H. longicornis/ rabbit. PBS plus adjuvant, Trx or KLH was used as control group. The antibodies of rabbits were detected by ELISA. Then, female ticks were fed on the rabbits until detachment. Results ELISA results showed that both vaccines induced rabbits to produce antibodies. Compared with the Trx group, the engorgement weight, oviposition and hatchability of the rPmy group decreased by 8.87%, 26.83% and 38.86%, respectively. On the other hand, engorgement weight, oviposition and hatchability of female ticks in the KLH-LEE group correspondingly resulted in 27.03%, 53.15% and 38.40% reduction compared with that of the KLH group. Considering the cumulative effect of vaccination on the evaluated parameters, results showed 60.37% efficacy of the rPmy vaccine formulation and 70.86% efficacy in the KLH-LEE group. Conclusions Pmy and particularly epitope LEE have potential for further development of an effective candidate vaccine to protect the host against tick infection.

Methods In this field study, households with flea- or tick-infested dog(s) were enrolled on Day 0 into the study to provide data for either the tick or flea infestation cohorts. Households were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the combination investigational product (IP, Credelio Plus ® tablets) or the control product (CP: Nexgard Spectra ® tablets). Dogs were administered IP (flea cohort n \u2009=\u2009135; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u2009147) or CP (flea cohort: n \u2009=\u200967; tick cohort: n \u2009=\u200974) once every 4 weeks for a total of three times at a dose rate of 20.0–41.5\xa0mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner and 0.75–1.53\xa0mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime (IP) or as recommended (CP). Percentage reduction was calculated by comparing individual dog flea and tick counts at each assessed post-treatment time point to their respective baseline (pre-treatment) infestation. Resolution of the clinical signs of flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) was assessed in flea-allergic dogs on the days that flea counts were performed. Results Flea effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® after 3 consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against Ctenocephalides felis , C. canis and Pulex irritans . Tick effectiveness of Credelio Plus ® over the same time frame was 99.3% for Ixodes ricinus and 100% against Rhipicephalus sanguineus ( s.l. ). Flea effectiveness of the CP after three consecutive monthly treatments was 100% against C. felis , C. canis and P. irritans . Tick effectiveness of the CP over the same time frame was 99.8% for I. ricinus and 100% against R. sanguineus . Credelio Plus ® was well tolerated based on the safety assessments in all treated dogs in this field study. Within both treatment groups there was a reduction in total FAD scores from baseline.

It is caused by the small ( Babesia gibsoni , B. conradae , and B. vulpes ) and large ( B. vogeli , B. canis , and B. rossi ) Babesia groups. As per the recent reports, the most prominent Babesia species encountered in the Kerala state are the small Babesia, B. gibsoni followed by the large Babesia, B. vogeli. The latter is regarded as mildly pathogenic, causing subclinical or mild disease; however severe complications like systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, etc. have also been reported. The information on the status of hematological alterations in naturally infected dogs with large Babesia is lacking, particularly from the state of Kerala. The present study involves a retrospective study of clinical cases of large Babesia infection in dogs.

"['Background Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) associated to ticks are among the most important health issues affecting dogs. In Italy, Ehrlichia canis , Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia conorii and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) have been studied in both healthy canine populations and those clinically ill with suspected CVBDs. However, little information is currently available on the overall prevalence and distribution of these pathogens in the country. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and distribution of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in clinically suspect dogs from three Italian macro areas during a 15-year period (2006–2020). Methods A large dataset ( n \u2009=\u200921,992) of serological test results for selected TBPs in three macro areas in Italy was analysed using a Chi-square test to evaluate the associations between the categorical factors (i.e. macro area, region, year, sex and age) and a standard logistic regression model (significance set at P \u2009=\u20090.05). Serological data were presented as annual and cumulative prevalence, and distribution maps of cumulative positive cases for TBPs were generated. Results Of the tested serum samples, 86.9% originated from northern (43.9%) and central (43%) Italy. The majority of the tests was requested for the diagnosis of E. canis (47%; n \u2009=\u200910,334), followed by Rickettsia spp. (35.1%; n \u2009=\u20097725), B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (11.6%; n \u2009=\u20092560) and Anaplasma spp. (6.2%; n \u2009=\u20091373). The highest serological exposure was recorded for B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (83.5%), followed by Rickettsia spp. (64.9%), Anaplasma spp. (39.8%) and E. canis (28.7%). The highest number of cumulative cases of Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was recorded in samples from Tuscany, central Italy. Rickettsia spp. was more prevalent in the south and on the islands, particularly in dogs on Sicily older than 6\xa0years, whereas Anaplasma spp. was more prevalent in the north and E. canis more prevalent in the south and on the islands. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the high seroprevalence and wide distribution of the four TBPs in dogs with clinically suspected CVBDs from the studied regions of Italy. The very high seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) exemplifies a limitation of this study, given the use of clinically suspect dogs and the possibility of cross-reactions when using serological tests. The present research provides updated and illustrative information on the seroprevalence and distribution of four key TBPs, and advocates for integrative control strategies for their prevention.

In domain III S6 region of the gene, a T2134C mutation was observed. Genotyping with allele-specific PCR targeting domain II S4-5 linker region using single larvae revealed that most R. sanguineus larvae in the study population were homozygous resistant (RR) genotypes, followed by heterozygous (RS) and homozygous susceptible (SS) genotypes.

"['Purpose Coxiella burnetii is known for its potential as veterinary and human bacterial pathogen. The bacteria have been described in ticks, but their role in transmission of Q fever in humans is considered low. Coxiella endosymbionts closely related to C. burnetii have been also isolated from an extensive range of tick species and evidence is growing that these endosymbionts could be linked to human bacteremia. The aim of this study was to get new information on the presence of Coxiella species in ticks infesting wild and domestic hosts in Sardinia, Italy. Methods Here, 138 ticks collected from the study area were analyzed for the presence of C. burnetii and Coxiella- like bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and philogenetic analyses using a set of primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Results DNA of Coxiella species was detected in 69% of the total ticks examined. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA Coxiella genotypes identified in this study grouped in strongly supported monophyletic clades with identified reference sequences of CLEs detected from Rhipicephalus , Dermacentor , Haemaphysalis and Ornithodoros species and with Coxiella burnetii strains isolated worldwide. Conclusion This study reports the molecular detection of a high diversity of Coxiella- like bacteria in Sardinian ticks and confirms also the presence of C. burnetii in tick species previously identified in the island. The role that Coxiella -like endosymbionts play in Sardinian ticks and in their vertebrate hosts needs to be explored further.']","['Chisu, Valentina, [Mura, Lorena], [Foxi, Cipriano], [Masala, Giovanna]']",['10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],[''],"['Coxiellaceae in Ticks from Human, Domestic and Wild Hosts from Sardinia, Italy: High Diversity of Coxiella-like Endosymbionts']"

Resistance status of one host tick Rhipicephalus microplus from two districts, Banaskantha (BK) and Patan (PN) of North Gujarat was tested against synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin and cypermethrin) by adult immersion test (AIT).Ticks were collected from six talukas each from BK and PN. Tick isolates from eight places showed resistance against deltamethrin having resistance factor ranging from 2.52–22.59. Further, isolates from six places, Ranuj, Dhanera, Radhanpur, Patan, Dhaneri and Kheda showed resistance against cypermethrin with resistance factor in range of 2.42–18.66. The results reveal a remarkable variance of susceptibility to deltamethrin and cypermethrin in the R. microplus populations studied. Isolates from PN district, from talukas Ranuj, Patan, Radhanpur, and Sidhpur were resistant to deltamethrin with resistance level II in all the places and resistance factors estimated were 16.73, 16.7, 9.64, and 7.25, respectively.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Punica granatum red peel and Acacia saligna leaf extracts on Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus GST activity in order to reduce the resistance of cattle to acaricide. The results showed that P. granatum ethanol extract (70%) contained the highest total phenol content (350\u2009±\u20091.2\xa0μM GAE g −1 ), the highest condensed tannin content (270\u2009±\u20091.3\xa0μM CE g −1 ) and the highest hydrolysable tannin content (70\u2009±\u20095.0\xa0μM TAE g −1 ).

These inhibitory effects were attributed to the presence of a high tannin concentration (≥\u200980%). HPLC analysis indicated the presence of gallic acid and catechin in both extracts, in addition to the rutin, which was only observed in A. saligna extracts.

"['Transmembrane conductance of small uncharged solutes such as glycerol typically occurs through aquaglyceroporins (Glps), which are commonly encoded by multiple genes in metazoan organisms. To date, however, little is known concerning the evolution of Glps in Crustacea or what forces might underly such apparent gene redundancy. Here, we show that Glp evolution in Crustacea is highly divergent, ranging from single copy genes in species of pedunculate barnacles, tadpole shrimps, isopods, amphipods and decapods to up to 10 copies in diplostracan water fleas although with monophyletic origins in each lineage. By contrast the evolution of Glps in Copepoda appears to be polyphyletic, with surprisingly high rates of gene duplication occurring in a genera- and species-specific manner. Based upon functional experiments on the Glps from a parasitic copepod ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ), we show that such lineage-level gene duplication and splice variation is coupled with a high rate of neofunctionalization. In the case of L. salmonis , splice variation of a given gene resulted in tissue- or sex-specific expression of the channels, with each variant evolving unique sites for protein kinase C (PKC)- or protein kinase A (PKA)-regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking. The combined data sets thus reveal that mutations favouring a high fidelity control of intracellular trafficking regulation can be a selection force for the evolution and retention of multiple Glps in copepods. Marc Catalán-Garcia et al. examine evolutionary divergence of aquaglyceroporins (GLPs) in copepods, observing that these genes are subject to high rates of gene duplication across species. They also report tissue- and sex-specific expression of GLP splice variants in the parasitic copepod, L. salmonis, that in turn exhibit PKA- or PKC-dependent changes in membrane trafficking. Altogether, these results suggest that mutations in GLP genes with precise regulation of intracellular tracking may be related to neofunctionalization in these species.']","['Catalán-García, Marc, [Chauvigné, François], [Stavang, Jon Anders], [Nilsen, Frank], [Cerdà, Joan], [Finn, Roderick Nigel]']",['10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01921-9'],[''],['Lineage-level divergence of copepod glycerol transporters and the emergence of isoform-specific trafficking regulation']

"['Background Hard ticks act as arthropod vectors in the transmission of human and animal pathogens and are widely distributed in northern China. The aim of this study is to screen the important tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) carried by hard ticks in Inner Mongolia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and to estimate the risk of human infection imposed by tick bites. Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level. Individual tick DNA samples were detected by genus--specific or group-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these TBPs and combined with DNA sequencing assay to confirm the results of mNGS. Results R. raoultii (45.32%, 92/203), Candidatus R. tarasevichiae (5.42%, 11/203), Anaplasma sp.

"['Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii , which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus . Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii -infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii -infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival. A retrospective power analysis found that our sampling effort had sufficient power (>\u200980%) to detect small effects (differences of 5% to 10%) of our treatments.

In Turkey, 19 pathogens transmitted by ticks to humans and animals have been reported. Based on this, this study aimed to investigate tick-borne pathogens including Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., and Bartonella spp. in tick samples ( n = 110) collected from different hosts (dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and turtles) by molecular methods. Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected. Hepatozoon spp. was detected in R. sanguineus ticks while Theileria spp. , Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected in R. turanicus and H. marginatum . According to the results of sequence analyses applied for pathogen positive samples, Hepatozoon canis , Theileria ovis , Babesia caballi , and Anaplasma ovis were identified.

"['Background Fragmented mitochondrial (mt) genomes and extensive mt gene rearrangements have been frequently reported from parasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera). However, relatively little is known about the mt genomes from the family Philopteridae, the most species-rich family within the suborder Ischnocera. Methods Herein, we use next-generation sequencing to decode the mt genome of Falcolipeurus suturalis and compare it with the mt genome of F. quadripustulatus . Phylogenetic relationships within the family Philopteridae were inferred from the concatenated 13 protein-coding genes of the two Falcolipeurus lice and members of the family Philopteridae using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Results The complete mt genome of F. suturalis is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule 16,659\xa0bp in size that contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and three non-coding regions. The gene order of the F. suturalis mt genome is rearranged relative to that of F. quadripustulatus , and is radically different from both other louse species and the putative ancestral insect. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clear genetic distinctiveness between F. suturalis and F. quadripustulatus (Bayesian posterior probabilities\u2009=\u20091.0 and bootstrapping frequencies\u2009=\u2009100), and that the genus Falcolipeurus is sister to the genus Ibidoecus (Bayesian posterior probabilities\u2009=\u20091.0 and bootstrapping frequencies\u2009=\u2009100).

Methods Client-owned dogs presenting to veterinary clinics from households in France, Hungary and Germany were screened for intestinal nematodes. Dogs with an initial positive faecal egg count that was subsequently confirmed with a follow-up faecal examination to demonstrate the presence of naturally occurring mixed or mono-infections with Toxocara canis , Toxascaris leonina , Trichuris vulpis or Ancylostoma caninum were enrolled on Day 0 into the study. Households were randomised in an approximately 2:1 ratio to receive either an investigational product (IP; Credelio Plus tablets) or control product (CP; Nexgard Spectra ® tablets) as treatment. Dogs were administered the IP ( n \u2009=\u2009278) or CP ( n \u2009=\u2009117) once on Day 0 at a dose rate of 0.75–1.56\xa0mg/kg bodyweight milbemycin oxime and 20.0–41.5\xa0mg/kg bodyweight lotilaner (IP) or as recommended (CP). Effectiveness of the IP and CP treatments was based on the post-treatment reduction in geometric mean faecal egg counts on Day 8 (range Day 7–10) after treatment as compared to their pre-treatment nematode faecal egg counts. Results Geometric mean (GM) faecal egg counts for T. canis , A caninum and T. vulpis were reduced by ≥ 97.2% in the Credelio Plus group and\u2009 by ≥\u200995.3% in the afoxolaner\u2009+\u2009milbemycin oxime group.

"['Background The hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum , is a common and important zoonotic intestinal nematode parasite that infects dogs globally. Both the immature and adult stages of A. caninum ingest large volumes of blood during the feeding process and can cause severe anemia and death in young dogs, even before patent infections can be diagnosed using routine faecal examination methods.

"['Biopesticides such as essential oils (EOs) are considered an improvement for integrated pest control as they appear to be less toxic to the environment than chemical acaricides. The current study aimed to evaluate the acaricidal activity of Artemisia herba-alba and Melia azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion as alternatives for chemical acaricides against the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii , besides evaluating their toxic effect on Swiss albino mice. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for the characterization of loaded nano-emulsions.The immersion test was used for the bioassay of both loaded nanoemulsions on tick stages (egg, nymph, larva, and adult). Mortality percentages and LC 50 values of each tick stage were calculated. Reproductive performance for the survived engorged females after treatment was monitored. The toxicity of both loaded nano-emulsions was evaluated on Swiss albino mice by an oral dose of 1500\xa0mg/kg/day for five successive days. The hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. TEM characterization revealed spherical droplets for A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion with droplet size ranging from 62 to 69\xa0nm and 52–91\xa0nm, respectively. FTIR revealed the absence of extra peaks in the loaded nano-emulsions that confirmed no chemical changes existed by ultrasonication. The LC 50 values of A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion on embryonated eggs, larvae, engorged nymphs, and unfed adults were 0.3 and 1.1%, 0.7 and 1.7%, 0.3 and 0.4%, 4.4 and 22.2%, respectively. The egg productive index (EPI), egg number, and hatchability percentage were lower in the treated females compared with Butox 5% (deltamethrin) and control. The hematological picture and biochemical analysis revealed insignificant changes in the treatment group compared with the negative control group. The liver of the A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion treated group exhibited vacuolar degeneration and infiltration of lymphocytic cells. The kidney of mice treated with A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion showed hemolysis and slight degeneration of epithelial cells of tubules.

"['The management of the Neotropical brown stinkbug Euschistus heros (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in soybean fields has been heavily dependent on the application of neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoids act primarily by impairing the function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the nervous system. These compounds also target specific organs (e.g., salivary glands), which may potentiate their insecticidal efficacy. Here, we evaluated whether the exposure to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid would cause cytomorphological changes in the salivary glands of E. heros . First, we determined the lethal concentrations (LCs) of imidacloprid through contact and ingestion. Subsequently, the cytomorphology of the salivary glands were evaluated in insect groups that survived exposure to the LC 5 (3.75\u2009mg a.i./L), LC 50 (112.5\u2009mg a.i./L), or LC 75 (375.0\u2009mg a.i./L, equivalent to the recommended field rate) doses. Imidacloprid induced apoptosis and necrosis in the salivary gland cells according to the insecticide concentration and salivary gland region. All concentrations increased apoptosis and injured cells (e.g., vacuolization, chromatin condensation, swelling of organelles, and plasma membrane rupture) in the principal and accessory salivary glands. Individuals that survived exposure to the highest concentrations (i.e., LC 5 and LC 50 ) were more affected, and exhibited several necrotic cells on their main principal salivary glands. Collectively, our results indicate that imidacloprid exerts toxic effects on the non-target organs, such as the salivary glands, which increases the efficacy of this compound in the management of stink bug infestations.']","['Castellanos, Nathaly L., [Ferreira-Filho, Noelio A.], [Rodrigues, Higor S.], [Martínez, Luis Carlos], [Serrão, José E.], [Oliveira, Eugenio E.]']",['10.1007/s10646-021-02388-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-021-02388-4'],[''],"['Imidacloprid-mediated alterations on the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros']"
"['Background Previously, twelve Rickettsia species were identified in ticks, fleas, sheep keds ( Melophagus ovinus ), bats ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) and a tick-bitten patient in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China. Here we aimed to molecularly detect rickettsial agents in red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ), marbled polecat ( Vormela peregusna ) and their ticks. Methods During 2018–2019, 12 red foxes, one marbled polecat and their ticks were sampled in two counties and a city of the XUAR. The heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of these 13 carnivores were dissected, followed by DNA extraction. Hard ticks were identified both morphologically and molecularly. All samples were examined for the presence of rickettsiae by amplifying four genetic markers ( 17-kDa, gltA, ompA, sca1 ). Results A total of 26 adult ticks and 28 nymphs (38 Ixodes canisuga , nine Ixodes kaiseri , six Haemaphysalis erinacei and one Dermacentor marginatus ) were collected from red foxes, and four Ha. erinacei ticks were removed from the marbled polecat. Analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) gene sequences indicated that 2–32 nucleotides differed between I. canisuga , I. kaiseri and Ha. erinacei from northwestern China and Europe. Rickettsia raoultii was detected in three red foxes, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in a red fox, Rickettsia sibirica in a red fox and a marbled polecat, and R. raoultii in two tick species ( I. canisuga and D . marginatus ). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, I. canisuga and I. kaiseri have not been previously reported from red foxes in China. The DNA of R. sibirica and R. raoultii was detected for the first time in the organs of red foxes, and R. sibirica in the organs of a marbled polecat. This is also the first molecular evidence for the presence of R. raoultii in I. canisuga .

"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18\xa0mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.

Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ).

"['The outbreak of COVID-19 leads to emergence of the global pandemic, but there is no specific vaccine recommended for COVID-19. More than 216 countries are struggling against the transmission of the disease, recovery and motility. Till date more than 0.948 million deaths out of 30.369 million confirmed cases are reported by WHO. Most of the nations adopted partial or complete ‘lockdown’ and imposed ‘social distancing’ to control the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and its consequence. Though global economic growth declined due to nationwide lockdown, there are certain positive impacts on environment. This review article has discussed the effects of nationwide lockdown aiming to community transmission COVID-19 on animal life behaviour and atmospheric environment in different aspects. In the lockdown period, the levels of NO 2 and carbon emission remarkably decrease in atmosphere due to restricted consumption of fossil fuel by industries, thermal power stations and air transportations. The concentration of NO 2 dropped by 45–54% in the atmosphere of most populated cities in Europe. The intensities of particulate matters PM 2.5 and PM 10 decreased by 43% and 31% respectively, at lower atmosphere indicating improvement in air qualities in different parts of world caused by less traffic and construction activities. SPM reduced up to 15.9%, showing improvement in surface water quality. New deserted bank has developed due to less river activities in this period. Noise pollution remarkably dropped below 60 db even in crowded cities. Thus, the atmospheric environment has resumed some extent in all respect by means of such global-wide lockdown aiming to control COVID-19 pandemic. The behavioural changes of wild animals, birds, butterfly, pets and street animals that reflected on ecosystem of their relative region indicate the non-interference of human activities on lives of natural creatures during lockdown period. There is certain correlation between atmospheric change with the behavioural changes of natural creature during lockdown period.

Objective This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of CM. Discussion This review evaluates the diagnosis, management, and empiric treatment of suspected CM in the ED. CM can easily evade diagnosis with a subacute presentation, and should be considered in any patient with a headache, neurological deficit, or who is immunocompromised. As a definitive diagnosis of CM will not be made in the ED, management of a patient with suspected CM includes prompt diagnostic testing and initiation of empiric treatment. Multiple types of newer Cryptococcal antigen tests provide high sensitivity and specificity both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients should be treated empirically for bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis, specifically with amphotericin B and flucytosine for presumed CM. Additionally, appropriate resuscitation and supportive care, including advanced airway management, management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), antipyretics, intravenous fluids, and isolation, should be initiated. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be initiated in the ED for those found or known to be HIV-positive for risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

"['Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a histopathologic description of a common form of small vessel vasculitis (SVV), that can be found in various types of vasculitis affecting the skin and internal organs. The leading clinical presentation of LCV is palpable purpura and the diagnosis relies on histopathological examination, in which the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of neutrophils with fibrinoid necrosis and disintegration of nuclei into fragments (“leukocytoclasia”). Several medications can cause LCV, as well as infections, or malignancy. Among systemic diseases, the most frequently associated with LCV are ANCA-associated vasculitides, connective tissue diseases, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch–Schonlein purpura) and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV). When LCV is suspected, an extensive workout is usually necessary to determine whether the process is skin-limited, or expression of a systemic vasculitis or disease. A comprehensive history and detailed physical examination must be performed; platelet count, renal function and urinalysis, serological tests for hepatitis B and C viruses, autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), complement fractions and IgA staining in biopsy specimens are part of the usual workout of LCV. The treatment is mainly focused on symptom management, based on rest (avoiding standing or walking), low dose corticosteroids, colchicine or different unproven therapies, if skin-limited. When a medication is the cause, the prognosis is favorable and the discontinuation of the culprit drug is usually resolutive. Conversely, when a systemic vasculitis is the cause of LCV, higher doses of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents are required, according to the severity of organ involvement and the underlying associated disease.']","['Fraticelli, Paolo, [Benfaremo, Devis], [Gabrielli, Armando]']",['10.1007/s11739-021-02688-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02688-x'],[''],['Diagnosis and management of leukocytoclastic vasculitis']
"['Background Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Methods Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models . Results The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp. ; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country. The conclusion of this review is extending the requirement of greater efforts in research and government management for the diagnosis and treatment and as well as prevention of these diseases so that tick-borne disease burden should be minimizing in India.']","['Negi, Tripti, [Kandari, Laxman Singh], [Arunachalam, Kusum]']",['10.1007/s00436-021-07114-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07114-x'],[''],['Update on prevalence and distribution pattern of tick-borne diseases among humans in India: a review']

Herein, we studied the seasonal dynamics of A. sculptum in an urban area of the Cerrado biome in midwestern Brazil, where human rickettsiosis is endemic. Ticks were collected in two sites located within the campus of Federal University of Goiás. The collections were done by dragging, flagging and visual search.

"['Tetracyclines belong to the first broad-spectrum, well-tolerated, and easy-to-administer antibiotics, which are effective against plague, cholera, typhoid, syphilis, Legionnaire’s disease, and anthrax. Some can also be used to treat malaria, Lyme disease, tuberculosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and leprosy. Humans first encountered these chemical species involuntarily in ancient times, as evidenced from the analysis of bone samples dating back more than 1500\xa0years. Shortly after World War\xa0II, they were “rediscovered” at Lederle Laboratories and Pfizer as a result of an intense search for new antibiotics. Their bacteriostatic action is based on the inhibition of protein biosynthesis. Since the structure elucidation by Robert Woodward, Lloyd Hillyard Conover, and others in the 1950s, tetracyclines have become preferred targets for natural product synthesis. However, on industrial scale, they became readily available by fermentation and partial synthesis. Their casual and thoughtless use in the initial decades after launch not only in humans but for veterinary purposes and as growth-enhancement agents in meat production rapidly led to the emergence of resistance. In an arms race for new antibiotics, more and more new drugs have been developed to deal with the threat. In this ongoing endeavor, a remarkable milestone was set by Andrew Myers in 2005 with the convergent total synthesis of (−)-doxycycline, as well as numerous azatetracyclines and pentacyclines, which has inspired chemists in the pharmaceutical industry to discover novel and highly active tetracyclines in recent years.

"['Background Pet dogs are important companion animals that share the environment within households, and play an important role in local community life. In addition, pet dogs also are reservoirs of zoonotic agents, including Rickettsia spp., thus increasing the risk of rickettsial infections in humans. It’s meaningful to investigate the epidemiology of rickettsial agents in pet dogs, and make contribute to the surveillance of rickettsioses in human in China. Results In this study, a total of 496 pet dogs’ blood samples and 343 ticks infested in pet dogs were collected, and the presence and prevalence of Rickettsia were determined by amplifying the partial gltA and 17-kDa genes, with an overall positive rate of 8.1\u2009% in blood samples and 14.0\u2009% in tick samples. In addition, the rrs , gltA , groEL , and ompA genes of rickettsial were also recovered to determine the species of Rickettsia detected furtherly. Sequencing blast and phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of three human pathogenic Rickettsia species ( Rickettsia raoultii , Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae and Rickettsia felis ) in samples associated with pet dogs. Moreover, all the sequences of Rickettsia that we obtained presented close relationship with others available in GenBank, and Rickettsia raoultii was the most predominant Rickettsia species infected in pet dogs’ blood samples or in tick samples. Conclusions This study provides the molecular epidemiology data about the Rickettsia spp. infection associated with pet dogs in urban areas of Harbin city. Three rickettisae species pathogenic to humans were identified from pet dogs’ blood and the infested ticks in urban areas of Harbin city. Considering the intimate relationship between human and pets, these results indicate the potential transmission risk of human rickettisal infections from pet dogs through ectoparasites, and also highlighting that more attention should be paid to rickettsial infection in pet dogs and the infested ticks from the “One health” perspective.']","['Shao, Jian-Wei, [Yao, Xin-Yan], [Song, Xu-Dong], [Li, Wen-Jun], [Huang, Hui-Lan], [Huang, Shu-Jian], [Zhang, Xue-Lian]']",['10.1186/s12917-021-02823-y'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02823-y'],[''],"['Molecular detection and genetic diversity of Rickettsia spp. in pet dogs and their infesting ticks in Harbin, northeastern China']"

They are responsible for spreading a multitude of pathogens and threatening the health and welfare of animals and human beings. However, given the history of tick-borne pathogen infections in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, surprisingly, neither the genetic diversity nor the spatial distribution of haplotypes within ticks has been studied. Methods We characterized the haplotype distribution of Dermacentor nuttalli in four main pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by sampling 109 individuals (recovered from sheep) in April–August 2019. The 16S rRNA gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) were amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA. Results Twenty-six haplotypes were identified using 16S rRNA sequences, 57 haplotypes were identified with COI sequences, and 75 haplotypes were identified with ITS2 sequences. Among the three genes, total haplotype diversity was greater than 0.7, while total nucleotide diversity was greater than 0.06. Neutrality tests revealed a significantly negative Tajima’s D result, while Fu's Fs was not significantly positive. Fixation index values (F ST ) indicated that the degree of genetic differentiation among some sampled populations was small, while for others it was moderate. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the variation within populations was greater than that among populations. The mismatch analysis of D. nuttalli exhibited double peaks.

"['In the very young child (less than eight years of age), transient loss of consciousness represents a diagnostic and management dilemma for clinicians. While most commonly benign, syncope may be due to cardiac dysfunction which can be life-threatening. It can be secondary to an underlying ion channelopathy, cardiac inflammation, cardiac ischemia, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension. Patients with genetic disorders require careful evaluation for a cardiac cause of syncope. Among the noncardiac causes, vasovagal syncope is the most common etiology. Breath-holding spells are commonly seen in this age group. Other causes of transient loss of consciousness include seizures, neurovascular pathology, head trauma, psychogenic pseudosyncope, and factitious disorder imposed on another and other forms of child abuse. A detailed social, present, past medical, and family medical history is important when evaluating loss of consciousness in the very young. Concerning characteristics of syncope include lack of prodromal symptoms, no preceding postural changes or occurring in a supine position, after exertion or a loud noise.

"['In the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, invasion and motility are coordinated by the master regulator HilD, which induces expression of the type III secretion system 1 (T3SS1) and motility genes. Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) detect specific ligands and control the direction of the flagellar motor, promoting tumbling and changes in direction (if a repellent is detected) or smooth swimming (in the presence of an attractant). Here, we show that HilD induces smooth swimming by upregulating an uncharacterized MCP (McpC), and this is important for invasion of epithelial cells. Remarkably, in vitro assays show that McpC can suppress tumbling and increase smooth swimming in the absence of exogenous ligands. Expression of mcpC is repressed by the universal regulator H-NS, which can be displaced by HilD. Our results highlight the importance of smooth swimming for Salmonella Typhimurium invasiveness and indicate that McpC can act via a ligand-independent mechanism when incorporated into the chemotactic receptor array. Protein HilD of Salmonella Typhimurium coordinates motility and host cell invasion by upregulating flagellar genes and a secretion system.

A combination of microbiological evolutionary mechanisms and systematic misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Four general mechanisms can cause resistance to antibiotics: inactivation or modification of the antibiotic, alteration of the target site of the antibiotic that reduces its binding capacity, modification of metabolic pathways to circumvent the antibiotic effect or reduction in intracellular antibiotic accumulation by decreasing the permeability, and increasing the efflux of the antibiotic. Moreover, environmental conditions, sociodemographic changes, and behavioral factors are also important contributors to re-emergence. The consequences are profound and include higher patient mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, higher medical costs, and the development of resistant bacteria that can defy available antibiotic treatments.

"['Background Several ungulate species are feeding and propagation hosts for the tick Ixodes ricinus as well as hosts to a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Here, we focus on Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ), two important pathogens for which ungulates are amplifying and dilution hosts, respectively. Ungulate management is one of the main tools to mitigate human health risks associated with these tick-borne pathogens. Across Europe, different species of ungulates are expanding their ranges and increasing in numbers. It is currently unclear if and how the relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus and the transmission cycles of tick-borne pathogens differ among these species. In this study, we aimed to identify these relative contributions for five European ungulate species. Methods We quantified the tick load and collected ticks and spleen samples from hunted fallow deer ( Dama dama , n \u2009=\u2009131), moose ( Alces alces , n \u2009=\u200915), red deer ( Cervus elaphus , n \u2009=\u200961), roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus , n \u2009=\u200930) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa , n \u2009=\u200987) in south-central Sweden. We investigated the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks and spleen samples using real-time PCR. We determined if ungulate species differed in tick load (prevalence and intensity) and in infection prevalence in their tissue as well as in the ticks feeding on them. Results Wild boar hosted fewer adult female ticks than any of the deer species, indicating that deer are more important as propagation hosts. Among the deer species, moose had the lowest number of female ticks, while there was no difference among the other deer species. Given the low number of infected nymphs, the relative contribution of all ungulate species to the transmission of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was low. Fallow deer, red deer and roe deer contributed more to the transmission of A. phagocytophilum than wild boar. Conclusions The ungulate species clearly differed in their role as a propagation host and in the transmission of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum .

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

"['Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m 2 ) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m 2 ) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.']","['Hansford, Kayleigh M., [McGinley, Liz], [Wilkinson, Samantha], [Gillingham, Emma L.], [Cull, Ben], [Gandy, Sara], [Carter, Daniel P.], [Vaux, Alexander G.

"['Background Relapsing fever (RF) borreliae are arthropod-borne spirochetes and some of them cause human diseases, which are characterized by relapsing or recurring episodes of fever. Recently, it has been classified into two groups: soft tick-borne RF (STRF) borreliae and hard tick-borne RF (HTRF) borreliae. STRF borreliae include classical RF agents and HTRF borreliae, the latter of which include B. miyamotoi , a human pathogen recently identified in Eurasia and North America. Results In this study, we determined the genome sequences of 16 HTRF borreliae strains: 15 B. miyamotoi strains (9 from Hokkaido Island, Japan, 3 from Honshu Island, Japan, and 3 from Mongolia) and a Borrelia sp. tHM16w. Chromosomal gene synteny was highly conserved among the HTRF strains sequenced in this study, even though they were isolated from different geographic regions and different tick species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sequences revealed that HTRF and STRF borreliae are clearly distinguishable, with each forming a monophyletic group in the RF borreliae lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary relationships of RF borreliae are consistent with the biological and ecological features of each RF borreliae sublineage and can explain the unique characteristics of Borrelia anserina . In addition, the pairwise genetic distances between HTRF borreliae strains were well correlated with those of vector species rather than with the geographical distances between strain isolation sites. This result suggests that the genetic diversification of HTRF borreliae is attributed to the speciation of vector ticks and that this relationship might be required for efficient transmission of HTRF borreliae within vector ticks. Conclusions The results of the present study, together with those from previous investigations, support the hypothesis that the common ancestor of borreliae was transmitted by hard-bodied ticks and that only STRF borreliae switched to using soft-bodied ticks as a vector, which was followed by the emergence of Borrelia recurrentis , lice-borne RF borreliae. Our study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships between RF borreliae, and the data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of RF borreliae.']","['Nakao, Ranna, [Kasama, Kentaro], [Boldbaatar, Bazartseren], [Ogura, Yoshitoshi], [Kawabata, Hiroki], [Toyoda, Atsushi], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Maeda, Ken]']",['10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],[''],['The evolution of hard tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae is correlated with vector species rather than geographical distance']
"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite.

Three patient groups are considered: (1) cancer patients; (2) hematopoietic or solid organ transplantation recipients; and (3) patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions requiring therapies that alter the host immune response. Recent Findings Clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities differ between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Infections can trigger the emergence of neurotropic antibodies or inflammatory conditions due to treatment with cancer immunotherapies. Unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.

"['Background The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE\u2009=\u200917.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi \u2009+\u2009 B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities.

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato\xa0(s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2\xa0years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects\xa0models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Results We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation.

"['Borrelia miyamotoi , a member of the tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes, shows a serum-resistant phenotype in vitro. This ability of B. miyamotoi may contribute to bacterial evasion of the host innate immune system. To investigate the molecular mechanism of serum-resistance, we constructed a membrane protein-encoding gene library of B. miyamotoi using Borrelia garinii strain HT59G, which shows a transformable and serum-susceptible phenotype. By screening the library, we found that bom1093 and bom1515 of B. miyamotoi provided a serum-resistant phenotype to the recipient B. garinii . These B. miyamotoi genes are predicted to encode P35-like antigen genes and are conserved among relapsing fever borreliae. Functional analysis revealed that BOM1093 bound to serum vitronectin and that the C-terminal region of BOM1093 was involved in the vitronectin-binding property. Importantly, the B. garinii transformant was not serum-resistant when the C terminus-truncated BOM1093 was expressed. We also observed that the depletion of vitronectin from human serum enhances the bactericidal activity of BOM1093 expressing B. garinii , and the survival rate of BOM1093 expressing B. garinii in vitronectin-depleted serum is enhanced by the addition of purified vitronectin. Our data suggests that B. miyamotoi utilize BOM1093-mediated binding to vitronectin as a mechanism of serum resistance.']","['Sato, Kozue, [Kumagai, Yumi], [Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi], [Kuroda, Makoto], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Gaowa], [Taylor, Kyle R.], [Ohnishi, Makoto], [Kawabata, Hiroki]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-85069-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85069-w'],[''],"['Vitronectin binding protein, BOM1093, confers serum resistance on Borrelia miyamotoi']"
"['Borrelia miyamotoi , a relapsing fever spirochete transmitted by Ixodid ticks causes B. miyamotoi disease (BMD). To evade the human host´s immune response, relapsing fever borreliae, including B. miyamotoi , produce distinct variable major proteins. Here, we investigated Vsp1, Vlp15/16, and Vlp18 all of which are currently being evaluated as antigens for the serodiagnosis of BMD. Comparative analyses identified Vlp15/16 but not Vsp1 and Vlp18 as a plasminogen-interacting protein of B. miyamotoi . Furthermore, Vlp15/16 bound plasminogen in a dose-dependent fashion with high affinity. Binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16 was significantly inhibited by the lysine analog tranexamic acid suggesting that the protein–protein interaction is mediated by lysine residues. By contrast, ionic strength did not have an effect on binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16. Of relevance, plasminogen bound to the borrelial protein cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2251 upon conversion by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPa), demonstrating it retained its physiological activity. Interestingly, further analyses revealed a complement inhibitory activity of Vlp15/16 and Vlp18 on the alternative pathway by a Factor H-independent mechanism.

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis varies over time and space through as yet incompletely understood mechanisms. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with a Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) genospecies, which is primarily transmitted by a bite of Ixodes ricinus nymphs. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in nymphal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (NIP), density of questing nymphs (DON) and the resulting density of infected nymphs (DIN). Methods We investigated the infection rates in I. ricinus nymphs that were collected monthly between 2009 and 2016 in 12 locations in the Netherlands. Using generalized linear mixed models, we explored how the NIP, DON and DIN varied during the seasons, between years and between locations. We also determined the genospecies of the Borrelia infections and investigated whether the genospecies composition differed between locations. Results The overall NIP was 14.7%. A seasonal pattern in infection prevalence was observed, with higher estimated prevalences in the summer than in the spring and autumn. This, combined with higher nymphal densities in summer, resulted in a pronounced summer peak in the estimated DIN. Over the 7.5-year study period, a significant decrease in infection prevalence was found, as well as a significant increase in nymphal density. These two effects appear to cancel each other out; the density of infected nymphs, which is the product of NIP × DON, showed no significant trend over years. Mean infection prevalence (NIP, averaged over all years and all months) varied considerably between locations, ranging from 5 to 26%. Borrelia genospecies composition differed between locations: in some locations almost all infections consisted of B. afzelii , whereas other locations had more diverse genospecies compositions. Conclusion In the Netherlands, the summer peak in DIN is a result of peaks in both NIP and DON. No significant trend in DIN was observed over the years of the study, and variations in DIN between locations were mostly a result of the variation in DON. There were considerable differences in acarological risk between areas in terms of infection prevalence and densities of ticks as well as in Borrelia genospecies composition.']","['Hartemink, Nienke, [Vliet, Arnold J.

Hard ticks are obligate haematophagous ectoparasites that serve as vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi . Studies on the presence of Lyme borreliosis in Egyptian animals and associated ticks are scarce. Methods This study was conducted to detect B. burgdorferi in different tick vectors and animal hosts. Three hundred animals (dogs=100, cattle=100, and camels=100) were inspected for tick infestation. Blood samples from 160 tick-infested animals and their associated ticks ( n =1025) were collected and examined for the infection with B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The identified tick species were characterized molecularly by PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 region. Results The overall tick infestation rate among examined animals was 78.33% (235/300). The rate of infestation was significantly higher in camels (90%), followed by cattle (76%) and dogs (69%); ( P = 0.001). Rhipicephalus sanguineus , Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus , and both Hyalomma dromedarii and Amblyomma variegatum, were morphologically identified from infested dogs, cattle, and camels; respectively. Molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region confirmed the morphological identification, as well as displayed high similarities of R. sanguineus, H. dromedarii, and A. Variegatu with ticks identified in Egypt and various continents worldwide. Just one dog (1.67%) and its associated tick pool of R. sanguineus were positive for B. burgdorferi infection. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for B. burgdorferi in dog and R. sanguineus tick pool showed a 100% homology. Conclusion Analyzed data revealed a relatively low rate of B. burgdorferi infection, but a significantly high prevalence of tick infestation among domesticated animals in Egypt, which possesses a potential animal and public health risk.

The aims of this study were to estimate tick infestation patterns on migratory birds and the prevalence of different Borrelia species and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks removed from birds in south-eastern Sweden. Methods Ticks were collected from resident and migratory birds captured at the Ottenby Bird Observatory, Öland, Sweden, from March to November 2009. Ticks were molecularly identified to species, and morphologically to developmental stage, and the presence of Borrelia bacteria and TBEV was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results A total of 1339 ticks in the genera Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma , and Ixodes was recorded of which I. ricinus was the most abundant species. Important tick hosts were the European robin ( Erithacus rubecula ), Blackbird ( Turdus merula ), Tree pipit ( Anthus trivialis ), Eurasian wren ( Troglodytes troglodytes ) , Common redstart ( Phoenicurus phoenicurus ) , Willow warbler ( Phylloscopus trochilus ), and Common whitethroat ( Sylvia communis ). Borrelia bacteria were detected in 25% (285/1,124) of the detached ticks available for analysis. Seven Borrelia species ( B. afzelii , B. burgdorferi ( s.s. ), B. garinii , B. lusitaniae , B. turdi, B. valaisiana , and B. miyamotoi ) were identified. B. turdi was recorded for the first time in ticks in Sweden. The number of Borrelia cells per tick ranged from 2.0 × 10 0 to 7.0 × 10 5 . B. miyamotoi -containing ticks contained a significantly higher median number of Borrelia cells than B. burgdorferi ( s.l. )-containing ticks. B. garinii and B. miyamotoi were the most prevalent Borrelia species in tick larvae. Larvae of I. ricinus with B. garinii were removed from seven bird species, particularly S. communis and A. trivialis , which may suggest that the larvae had contracted the Borrelia bacteria from or via these birds. Also, a high percentage of tick larvae containing B. miyamotoi was removed from E. rubecula. All ticks were negative for TBEV. Conclusions The results corroborate the view that the contributions of birds to human disease are substantial, particularly as blood hosts for ticks and for their short-, medium-, and long-distance dispersal.

"['Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) act as important vectors of zoonotic pathogens. For instance, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes pose a severe health risk as aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis. Commonly, to study the abundance of questing (host-seeking) ticks, a 1 m 2 piece of cloth is dragged over vegetation for a determined distance. Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased.']","['Nyrhilä, Siiri, [Sormunen, Jani J.], [Mäkelä, Satu], [Sippola, Ella], [Vesterinen, Eero J.], [Klemola, Tero]']",['10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],[''],['One out of ten: low sampling efficiency of cloth dragging challenges abundance estimates of questing ticks']
"['Background K-mer spectra of DNA sequences contain important information about sequence composition and sequence evolution. We want to reveal the evolution rules of genome sequences by studying the k-mer spectra of genome sequences. Results The intrinsic laws of k-mer spectra of 920 genome sequences from primate to prokaryote were analyzed. We found that there are two types of evolution selection modes in genome sequences, named as CG Independent Selection and TA Independent Selection. There is a mutual inhibition relationship between CG and TA independent selections. We found that the intensity of CG and TA independent selections correlates closely with genome evolution and G\u2009+\u2009C content of genome sequences. The living habits of species are related closely to the independent selection modes adopted by species genomes. Consequently, we proposed an evolution mechanism of genomes in which the genome evolution is determined by the intensities of the CG and TA independent selections and the mutual inhibition relationship. Besides, by the evolution mechanism of genomes, we speculated the evolution modes of prokaryotes in mild and extreme environments in the anaerobic age and the evolving process of prokaryotes from anaerobic to aerobic environment on earth as well as the originations of different eukaryotes.

"['Background Borrelia bavariensis is one of the agents of Lyme Borreliosis (or Lyme disease) in Eurasia. The genome of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, that includes B. bavariensis , is known to be very complex and fragmented making the assembly of whole genomes with next-generation sequencing data a challenge. Results We present a genome reconstruction for 33 B. bavariensis isolates from Eurasia based on long-read (Pacific Bioscience, for three isolates) and short-read (Illumina) data. We show that the combination of both sequencing techniques allows proper genome reconstruction of all plasmids in most cases but use of a very close reference is necessary when only short-read sequencing data is available. B. bavariensis genomes combine a high degree of genetic conservation with high plasticity: all isolates share the main chromosome and five plasmids, but the repertoire of other plasmids is highly variable. In addition to plasmid losses and gains through horizontal transfer, we also observe several fusions between plasmids. Although European isolates of B. bavariensis have little diversity in genome content, there is some geographic structure to this variation. In contrast, each Asian isolate has a unique plasmid repertoire and we observe no geographically based differences between Japanese and Russian isolates. Comparing the genomes of Asian and European populations of B. bavariensis suggests that some genes which are markedly different between the two populations may be good candidates for adaptation to the tick vector, ( Ixodes ricinus in Europe and I. persulcatus in Asia).

"['Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK–STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host.

To increase our understanding of TBEV-tick interactions, we collected ticks from different areas within Germany (Haselmühl/Bavaria, Hanover/Lower Saxony) and infected them via an in vitro feeding system. A TBEV isolate was obtained from an endemic focus in Haselmühl. In two experimental series conducted in 2018 and 2019, ticks sampled in Haselmühl (TBEV focus) showed higher artificial feeding rates, as well as higher TBEV infections rates than ticks from the non-endemic area (Hanover).

Methods Questing ticks were collected by flagging in seven recreational locations, from four types of habitats in Cluj-Napoca, Romania: parks; gardens; a cemetery; and peri-urban forests. Hedgehogs, birds and micromammals were also sampled and searched for ticks, using standard methods (i.e. torch-based searches, ornithological mist nets, snap-traps, etc.), while vegetation was evaluated on surveyed areas. Data on questing ticks were converted to abundance indices. Moodʼs median tests were used to assess the relationship between the abiotic and biotic factors and the abundance of questing ticks. Results Two species of questing ticks were found: Ixodes ricinus (96.8%) and Haemaphysalis punctata (3.2%). Ixodes ricinus was also the predominant engorged tick collected from urban wildlife. For I. ricinus the highest mean total abundance index/location (total no. of ticks/100 m 2 ) was recorded in the urban gardens (3.79, 95% CI:\u2009±\u20091.59) and parks (2.68, 95% CI:\u2009±\u20090.75), whereas the lowest mean total abundance index was noted in the peri-urban forests (0.06, 95% CI:\u2009±\u20090.03) and the urban cemetery (0.04, 95% CI:\u2009±\u20090.02).

"['Background Because ixodid ticks are vectors of zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia , information of their abundance, seasonal variation in questing behaviour and pathogen prevalence is important for human health.

We assessed seasonal variation in questing abundance of ticks and their pathogen prevalence in coastal deciduous forests near the city of Oulu (latitudes 64–65°) in 2019. Methods We sampled ticks from May until September by cloth dragging 100 meters once a month at eight study sites. We calculated a density index (individuals/100\xa0m 2 ) to assess seasonal variation. Samples were screened for Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) (including B. afzelii , B. garinii , B. burgdorferi ( sensu stricto ) and B. valaisana ), Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Rickettsia spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis , Francisella tularensis and Bartonell a spp., Babesia spp. and for the tick-borne encephalitis virus. Results All except one nymph were identified as I. persulcatus. The number of questing adults showed a strong peak in May (median: 6.5\xa0adults/100\xa0m 2 ), which is among the highest values reported in northern Europe, and potentially indicates a large population size. After May, the number of questing adults declined steadily with few adults still sampled in August. Nymphs were present from May until September. We found a striking prevalence of Borrelia spp. in adults (62%) and nymphs (40%), with B. garinii (51%) and B. afzelii (63%) being the most common species. In addition, we found that 26% of infected adults were coinfected with at least two Borrelia genospecies, mainly B. garinii and B. afzelii , which are associated with different host species. Conclusions The coastal forest environments at Bothnian Bay seem to provide favourable environments for I. persulcatus and the spread of Borrelia . High tick abundance, a low diversity of the host community and similar host use among larvae and nymphs likely explain the high Borrelia prevalence and coinfection rate. Research on the infestation of the hosts that quantifies the temporal dynamics of immature life stages would reveal important aspects of pathogen circulation in these tick populations.']","['Pakanen, Veli-Matti, [Sormunen, Jani J.], [Sippola, Ella], [Blomqvist, Donald], [Kallio, Eva R.]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04259-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04259-z'],[''],['Questing abundance of adult taiga ticks Ixodes persulcatus and their Borrelia prevalence at the north-western part of their distribution']

Several hard tick species are of medical and veterinary interest in Europe, and changes in the range of tick species can affect the spread of zoonotic pathogens. The aim of the present study was to map the current prevalence and distribution pattern of ticks and related tick-borne pathogens in Latvia, a Baltic state in northern Europe. Methods Nearly 4600 Ixodes ricinus , I. persulcatus and Dermacentor reticulatus tick samples were collected in all regions of Latvia during 2017–2019 and were screened by molecular methods to reveal the prevalence and distribution pattern of a wide spectrum of tick-borne pathogens. Results New localities of D. reticulatus occurrence were found in western and central Latvia, including the Riga region, indicating that the northern border of D. reticulatus in Europe has moved farther to the north. Among the analyzed ticks, 33.42% carried at least one tick-borne pathogen, and 5.55% of tick samples were positive for two or three pathogens. A higher overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens was observed in I. ricinus (34.92%) and I. persulcatus (31.65%) than in D. reticulatus (24.2%). The molecular analysis revealed the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus, Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. Overall, 15 and 7 tick-borne pathogen species were detected in Ixodes spp. and D. reticulatus ticks, respectively.

"['Pharmaceutical drugs have emerged as major micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems. Their presence has been systematically reported in monitoring surveys, and their wide distribution and constant presence in the wild is a direct consequence of their massive use, in both human and veterinary therapeutics. Drugs used to treat parasitic infections in livestock are major contaminants, given the amounts in which they are administered, and reach the aquatic compartment in high amounts, where they may affect non target species. Some of these drugs are prone to find their final deposit in sediments of estuarine areas, exerting their toxic effects preferentially at these locations. Sediment dwelling organisms of coastal areas, such as polychaetas, are especially prone to have their major physiological functions compromised after being exposed to pharmaceutical drugs. Ivermectin is one of the most used antiparasitic drugs, and its effects are not limited to biochemical traits, but also behavioral features may be compromised considering their neurotoxic actions. Despite these putative effects, little is known about their toxicity on polychaetas. The present study aimed to characterize the toxicity of realistic levels of ivermectin on the polychaeta Hediste diversicolor , in biochemical and behavioral terms. The obtained results showed that low levels of ivermectin are capable of causing significant disturbances in mobility and burrowing activity of exposed worms, as well as alterations of metabolic and anti-oxidant defense efficacy of exposed animals, suggesting that its environmental presence may mean a major environmental concern.']","['Nunes, B., [Pinheiro, D.], [Gomes, A.]']",['10.1007/s10646-021-02444-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-021-02444-z'],[''],['Effect of sublethal concentrations of the antiparasitic ivermectin on the polychaeta species Hediste diversicolor: biochemical and behavioral responses']
"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

Required (constrained by mortality) and optimal (related to growth) habitats were calculated for multiple life stages. The combination of physiological limitations and environmental variability had a wide range of effects that depended on a species’ physiological tolerances. While salinity and dissolved oxygen were the primary constraints on required habitat volumes, salinity and temperature had the strongest constraint on optimal habitat volumes. Predictive relationships between physiological tolerances and changes in habitat volumes were identified and could be used to estimate habitat limitation in estuaries where 3D models are unavailable.

Phylogenetic analyses performed with the ITS and cox 1 data sets using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference unequivocally showed that new sequences of P. diovadena recovered from the white ibis formed a clade with other sequences of specimens previously identified as P. diovadena. The intraspecific genetic divergence among the isolates was very low, ranging from 0 to 0.38% for ITS and from 0 to 1.5% for cox 1 , and in combination with the phylogenetic trees confirmed that the isolates belonged to the same species.

Most captured terns were subadults and adults aged three years and older, although ca. 22% of trapped Common Terns were immatures aged one–two years. Mean body mass values of Common and Roseate Terns were substantially lower than published values reported from European breeding sites. In both species, females were, on average, lighter than males, and in the Common Tern, immatures were also lighter than older individuals. Based on the subset of recoveries of birds initially marked at birth in Europe, we found significant differences in body mass according to natal origin in Common Terns but not in Roseate Terns. The variations reported for the former species were mainly attributed to size, with lighter and smaller individuals originating from the British Isles, intermediate individuals from western/central Europe, and heavier and larger birds from Fennoscandian countries. Capture date, used as a proxy measure of timing of migration, showed a strong covariation with body mass in both species. In fact, as the spring season progressed, mist-netted birds became progressively heavier, irrespective of age and natal origin. This suggests that earlier and lighter migrants may have opted for a more protracted migration duration involving more frequent and/or longer refueling periods. Conversely, late migrants needed greater body reserves to achieve the return journey to the colonies within a shorter period to arrive on time for the breeding season. Global climate phenomena such as the North Atlantic and Southern Oscillation indices did not explain inter-annual variations in body mass during the course of this study. Overall, our results suggest that, during the non-breeding season, body mass in these two long-distance migratory species is mainly shaped by intrinsic factors and inter-individual variation in migration strategy. Die Körpermasse variiert bei zwei langlebigen Seevogelarten während des Frühjahrszuges mit Fangdatum, Alter, Geschlecht und Ort des Schlüpfens Studien zum Rückschluss aus der Körpermasse sind bei Seevögeln außerhalb der Brutzeiten selten, weil es methodisch schwierig ist, dann einzelne Individuen zu untersuchen. Wir verwendeten Daten von 6800 Vögeln, die in 12 Jahren zwischen 2000 und 2019 in La Somone, Senegal, entlang des Ostatlantischen Zugwegs mit Netzen gefangen wurden, um die Rolle von intrinsischen und umweltbedingten Faktoren bei der Erklärung von Körpermassenunterschieden sowohl bei der Flussseeschwalbe Sterna hirundo als auch der Rosenseeschwalbe S. dougallii zu prüfen. Die meisten der gefangenen Seeschwalben waren subadulte oder adulte Tiere im Alter von drei Jahren oder älter; 22% der gefangenen Seeschwalben waren Jungtiere im Alter von ein bis zwei Jahren. Die mittleren Körpermassewerte der Fluss- und Rosenseeschwalben lagen deutlich unter den Werten, die für europäische Brutplätze publiziert worden sind. Bei beiden Arten waren die Weibchen im Durchschnitt leichter als die Männchen, bei der Flussseeschwalbe waren auch die Jungtiere leichter als ältere Individuen. Anhand derjenigen Wiederfänge, die ursprünglich nach dem Schlüpfen in Europa beringt worden waren, stellten wir bei den Flussseeschwalben im Gegensatz zu den Rosenseeschwalben signifikante Unterschiede in der Körpermasse in Abhängigkeit vom Ort des Schlüpfens fest. Die für die erstere Art berichteten Unterschiede wurden hauptsächlich auf die Größe zurückgeführt, wobei die leichteren und kleineren Individuen von den Britischen Inseln, die mittelgroßen Tiere aus West-/Mitteleuropa und die schwereren, größeren Vögel aus den fenno-skandinavischen Ländern stammten. Das Fangdatum, das als Ersatzmaß für den Zeitpunkt des Zugbeginns verwendet wurde, zeigte bei beiden Arten einen starken Zusammenhang mit der Körpermasse. Tatsächlich waren mit fortschreitendem Frühjahr die mit Netzen gefangenen Vögel immer schwerer, unabhängig von Alter und Ort des Schlüpfens. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass früher abgeflogene und leichtere Vögel sich möglicherweise für eine längere Zugzeit entschieden haben, was häufigere und/oder längere Aufenthalte für die Nahrungsaufnahme bedeutete. Umgekehrt brauchten später losgezogene Tiere größere Reserven, um die Rückreise zu den Brutkolonien in kürzerer Zeit zu schaffen und so rechtzeitig zur Brutsaison anzukommen. Globale Klimaphänomene wie der Index der Nordatlantischen und der Südlichen Oszillation konnten die im Verlauf dieser Studie festgestellten zwischenjährlichen Schwankungen der Körpermasse nicht erklären. Insgesamt deuten unsere Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass die Körpermasse bei diesen beiden Langstreckenziehern außerhalb der Brutzeiten hauptsächlich durch intrinsische Faktoren und von interindividuellen Variationen in der Zugstrategie bestimmt wird.']","['Monticelli, David, [Defourny, Hugues], [Degros, Emile], [Degros, André]']",['10.1007/s10336-021-01903-y'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01903-y'],[''],"['Body mass during the spring migration period of two long-lived seabirds varies with capture date, age, sex, and natal origin']"

"['Background Previously, twelve Rickettsia species were identified in ticks, fleas, sheep keds ( Melophagus ovinus ), bats ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) and a tick-bitten patient in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China. Here we aimed to molecularly detect rickettsial agents in red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ), marbled polecat ( Vormela peregusna ) and their ticks. Methods During 2018–2019, 12 red foxes, one marbled polecat and their ticks were sampled in two counties and a city of the XUAR. The heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of these 13 carnivores were dissected, followed by DNA extraction. Hard ticks were identified both morphologically and molecularly. All samples were examined for the presence of rickettsiae by amplifying four genetic markers ( 17-kDa, gltA, ompA, sca1 ). Results A total of 26 adult ticks and 28 nymphs (38 Ixodes canisuga , nine Ixodes kaiseri , six Haemaphysalis erinacei and one Dermacentor marginatus ) were collected from red foxes, and four Ha. erinacei ticks were removed from the marbled polecat. Analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) gene sequences indicated that 2–32 nucleotides differed between I. canisuga , I. kaiseri and Ha. erinacei from northwestern China and Europe. Rickettsia raoultii was detected in three red foxes, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in a red fox, Rickettsia sibirica in a red fox and a marbled polecat, and R. raoultii in two tick species ( I. canisuga and D . marginatus ). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, I. canisuga and I. kaiseri have not been previously reported from red foxes in China. The DNA of R. sibirica and R. raoultii was detected for the first time in the organs of red foxes, and R. sibirica in the organs of a marbled polecat. This is also the first molecular evidence for the presence of R. raoultii in I. canisuga .

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"
"['While it is common knowledge that Red Drum ( Sciaenops ocellatus ) inhabit oligohaline waters (salinity <5), lifetime reconstructions of salinity histories have been lacking, and this study provides unique insight into interannual and ontogenetic patterns of oligohaline occupancy by this economically valuable sportfish . Growth consequences of oligohaline exposure and the relationship of oligohaline residency with river discharge were also investigated. Oligohaline exposure varied most during years 2 and 3 of life. During this time, 22% ( n \u2009=\u200926/120 individuals) of Red Drum were oligohaline residents (≥ 90% of these years spent in oligohaline salinities), 34% ( n \u2009=\u200941) were meso-polyhaline residents (< 10% of years 2 and 3 spent in oligohaline waters), and 44% ( n \u2009=\u200953) spent time in both oligohaline and meso-polyhaline salinities. Trends in oligohaline residency match putative Red Drum life history. Oligohaline residents were present during years 1–6 of life; however, oligohaline residency peaked during the second year of life ( n \u2009=\u200937, 31%) and by year 7 no oligohaline residents remained. Growth of oligohaline resident Red Drum during years 2–3 of life was lower than non-resident fish. However, long-term growth consequences of oligohaline residency were not apparent. The proportion of oligohaline residents during years 2 or 3 of life was positively related to river discharge. This divergence in salinity residency by juvenile Red Drum demonstrates that life history diversity was present in this population and that oligohaline waters provided important nursery habitat for fish that successfully recruited to the adult population.']","['Nelson, T.

"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']

"['This paper draws upon the theory of embodied cognition to provide a robust account of how gestural interactions with and around multi-touch tabletops can play an important role in facilitating collaborative meaning-making, particularly in the context of science data visualizations. Embodied cognition is a theory of learning that implies that thinking and perception are shaped by interactions with the physical environment. Previous research has used embodied cognition as a theoretical framework to inform the design of large touchscreen learning applications such as for multi-touch tabletops. However, this prior work has primarily assumed that learning is occurring during any motion or interaction, without considering how specific interactions may be linked to particular instances of collaborative learning supported by embodiment. We investigate this question in the context of collaborative learning from data visualizations of global phenomena such as ocean temperatures. We followed a user-centered, iterative design approach to build a tabletop prototype that facilitated collaborative meaning-making and used this prototype as a testbed in a laboratory study with 11 family groups. We qualitatively analyzed learner groups’ co-occurring utterances and gestures to identify the nature of gestural interactions groups used when their utterances signaled the occurrence of embodiment during collaborative meaning-making. Our findings present an analysis of both touchscreen and above-the-surface gestural interactions that were associated with instances of embodied cognition. We identified four types of gestural interactions that promote scientific discussion and collaborative meaning-making through embodied cognition: (T1) gestures for orienting the group; (T2) cooperative gestures for facilitating group meaning-making; (T3) individual intentional gestures for facilitating group meaning-making; and (T4) gestures for articulating conceptual understanding to the group. Our work illustrates interaction design opportunities for affording embodied cognition and will inform the design of future interactive tabletop experiences in the domain of science learning.']","['Soni, Nikita, [Darrow, Alice], [Luc, Annie], [Gleaves, Schuyler], [Schuman, Carrie], [Neff, Hannah], [Chang, Peter], [Kirkland, Brittani], [Alexandre, Jeremy], [Morales, Amanda], [Stofer, Kathryn A.], [Anthony, Lisa]']",['10.1007/s11412-021-09341-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-021-09341-x'],[''],['Affording embodied cognition through touchscreen and above-the-surface gestures during collaborative tabletop science learning']

"['Background Belonging to the anopluran family Echinophthiriidae, Echinophthirius horridus , the seal louse, has been reported to parasitise a broad range of representatives of phocid seals. So far, only a few studies have focused on the vector function of echinophthiriid lice, and knowledge about their role in pathogen transmission is still scarce. The current study aims to investigate the possible vector role of E. \xa0 horridus parasitising seals in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Methods E.\xa0horridus seal lice were collected from 54 harbour seals ( Phoca vitulina ) and one grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus ) during their rehabilitation period at the Sealcentre Pieterburen, The Netherlands. DNA was extracted from pooled seal lice of individual seals for molecular detection of the seal heartworm Acanthocheilonema spirocauda , the rickettsial intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum , and the cell wall-less bacteria Mycoplasma\xa0 spp. using PCR assays. Results Seal lice from 35% of the harbour seals (19/54) and from the grey seal proved positive for A. \xa0 spirocauda . The seal heartworm was molecularly characterised and phylogenetically analysed (rDNA, cox1 ). A nested PCR was developed for the cox1 gene to detect A. spirocauda stages in seal lice. A. \xa0 phagocytophilum and a Mycoplasma species previously identified from a patient with disseminated ‘seal finger’ mycoplasmosis were detected for the first time, to our knowledge, in seal lice. Conclusions Our findings support the potential vector role of seal lice in the transmission of A. spirocauda and reveal new insights into the spectrum of pathogens occurring in seal lice. Studies on vector competence of E. horridus , especially for bacterial pathogens, are essentially needed in the future as these pathogens might have detrimental effects on the health of seal populations. Furthermore, studies on the vector role of different echinophthiriid species infecting a wide range of pinniped hosts should be conducted to extend the knowledge of vector-borne pathogens.']","['Hirzmann, Jörg, [Ebmer, David], [Sánchez-Contreras, Guillermo J.], [Rubio-García, Ana], [Magdowski, Gerd], [Gärtner, Ulrich], [Taubert, Anja], [Hermosilla, Carlos]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04586-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04586-9'],[''],['The seal louse (Echinophthirius horridus) in the Dutch Wadden Sea: investigation of vector-borne pathogens']

"['Vertical mixing in the ocean is an important physical process that brings deep nutrients to the upper layer. The Tokara Strait, where the Kuroshio flows out to the North Pacific from the East China Sea, is known for a mixing hotspot, but the associated vertical nutrient transport has not been well quantified yet, especially in the intermediate layer below 200\xa0m depth. This study involved flow, turbulence, and nitrate observations to quantify the vertical turbulent nitrate flux in the Tokara Strait and discuss its impact on the Kuroshio nutrient transport. Temporal variation of current velocity, derived from a 3.5-day mooring observation, captured semi-diurnal internal waves propagating vertically at depths between 200 and 400\xa0m. Vertical shear associated with the semi-diurnal flow was elevated at this depth range. Vertical shear due to the mean and the diurnal flow was also elevated at about 220\xa0m and 400\xa0m depths, respectively. Mean vertical eddy diffusivity was elevated to O (10 –3 –10 –2 m 2 \xa0s −1 ) at the density layers of 25.2–26.4 σ θ (200–450\xa0m depth). Associated vertical turbulent nitrate flux reached O (10\xa0mmol\xa0m −2 \xa0day −1 ), especially at around 25.6 σ θ (250\xa0m depth) and 26.2–26.4 σ θ (400–450\xa0m depth).

"['Background Numerous laboratory and fewer field-based studies have found that ixodid ticks develop more quickly and survive better at temperatures between 18 °C and 26\xa0°C and relative humidity (RH) between 75 and 94%. Ixodes anatis Chilton, 1904, is an endophilic, nidicolous species endemic to North Island brown kiwi ( Apteryx mantelli ) (NIBK) and the tokoeka ( Apteryx australis ), and little is known about the environmental conditions required for its development. The aims of this study were to determine and compare the conditions of temperature and RH that ensure the best survival of the kiwi tick and the shortest interstadial periods, in laboratory conditions and outdoors inside artificial kiwi burrows. Methods Free-walking engorged ticks were collected off wild kiwi hosts and placed in the laboratory under various fixed temperature and humidity regimes. In addition, sets of the collected ticks at different developmental stages were placed in artificial kiwi burrows. In both settings, we recorded the times taken for the ticks to moult to the next stage. Results Larvae and nymphs both showed optimum development at between 10 °C and 20\xa0°C, which is lower than the optimum temperature for development in many other species of ixodid ticks. However, larvae moulted quicker and survived better when saturation deficits were\u2009<\u20091–2\xa0mmHg (RH\u2009>\u200994%); in comparison, the optimum saturation deficits for nymph development were 1–10\xa0mmHg.

This is especially true for biting Diptera, where light traps play a crucial role in disease surveillance by tracking the presence and abundance of vector species. Physiological and behavioural data have been instrumental in identifying factors that influence dipteran phototaxis and have spurred the development of more effective light traps. However, the development of less attractive domestic lights has received comparatively little interest but could be important for reducing interactions between humans and vector insects, with consequences for reducing disease transmission. Here, we discuss how dipteran eyes respond to light and the factors influencing positive phototaxis, and conclude by identifying key areas for further research. In addition, we include a synthesis of attractive and unattractive wavelengths for a number of vector species.

Changes in infectious diseases transmission patterns are a likely consequence of changing climates, a neglected problem that is likely to have a profound effect on northern societies, including indigenous cultures. There is an urgent need to learn more about the complex underlying dynamic relationships, and apply this information to the prediction of future CSI impacts, using more complete, better validated, and integrated data and models. This chapter provides an overview of the thoughts behind the CLINF NCoE (Nordic Centre of Excellence), and the integrative context expressed therein. The most recent findings regarding climate change in the Arctic, as published by IPCC and other global networks, are presented. In the international CLINF consortium of researchers, nine human and 18 animal husbandry diseases have been selected for study due to their potential for being climate sensitive. The human infections were selected by an international consortium of researchers, to represent fundamentally different transmission processes. The main CLINF objectives are the construction of practical tools for the decision-makers who are responsible for the development of northern societies. By contributing to the development of an early warning system for increased risks for CSIs to spread at the local level effective policy responses may be formulated.

"['The chapter proposed is based on recent studies in Muscat/Oman (as example for other arid states in the Gulf Region) on the development of green infrastructure. Aim is to extend green areas in the city to enhance the quality of life for the residents and to support a sustainable urban development. As strategic tool, existing wadis (dry river beds) which are currently dividing the urban fabric apart will be used as new open green spaces. Those Wadis are mostly characterized today as “empty areas” with blank soil in the middle of the city. Wadis cannot due to the danger of flash floods be designed as normal urban parks but rather as green open spaces for recreational activities, sports, relaxing and in the flood safe higher areas also for picnic. These activities were highlighted in two sets of questionnaires of German and Omani researchers (200 and 300 interviews) by asking local residents for their outdoor activity preferences. The main objective of two studies in 2017 and 2018 in Muscat, Oman, was to identify resident’s needs, to analyze spatial potentials and to develop technical approaches for a transformation of wadis into green urban spaces for recreational activities. Various methods, including literature research, GIS analysis, expert interviews, surveys among residents, exploration of sites, and designing drafts in joint workshops of German and Omani students were applied to accomplish these objectives. Findings showed that Wadis are already used by the residents for various informal activities and can be also seen as valuable urban space with a great potential to create new green public spaces. The requirements of such parks vary significantly among different target groups. Here, cultural backgrounds and gender play a major role so that the Wadi parks should consist of tailor-made areas. The feasibility of this approach has been confirmed by expert interviews. Surprisingly, water as fundamental resource for green spaces in arid countries is not the bottleneck. Treated waste water, nowadays discharged into the Omani sea, could be used in large quantities for irrigation. But green areas in wadis have to consider the danger of flash floods and thus to be designed at a low intervention level. The feasibility of Wadis as flash flood prone parks with facilities requested by residents has been confirmed by several test designs.']","['Scholz, Wolfgang, [Kaiser, Mathias], [Pallasch, Matthias]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-50540-0_25'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50540-0_25'],[''],['The Potentials and Risks of Wadis in Cities in the Gulf Region']

Marine cyanobacteria gene expression and cell division have been shown to exhibit a diel cycle, and their light-driven oscillations have been linked to community-wide diel cycles of gene expression, including those of heterotrophic members of the microbial communities. A growing body of evidence shows that cyanophages (viruses infecting cyanobacteria) are an important component of microbial assemblages in the oceans and that they show diel patterns of expression that are similar to those of their hosts.

"['The objective of this study is to propose a cybersecurity curriculum from a best practice perspective for universities and other higher educational institutions. Cybersecurity is a fast-growing part of the overall job market and cybersecurity skills shortage is a factor that needs attention worldwide. An updated approach is needed to build the cybersecurity labour force. A scoping literature review was applied on academic databases for proposed cybersecurity skills curricula. It was also applied on cybersecurity curricula offered by top universities as well as by studying cybersecurity curriculum frameworks and guidelines. The knowledge, skills, abilities and modules from the aforementioned were integrated to compile a holistic reference point for a cybersecurity curriculum. The study found that there is a global need for cybersecurity degrees and specifically for African countries like South African. More cybersecurity professionals need to be trained in the necessary technical abilities, combined by the necessary soft skills to be productive and fill the gaps in industry.

"['If schedule pressure weighed heavily upon the shoulders of the Shuttle fleet, then the predations of Mother Nature – who routinely manifested her wrath through hurricanes and rain-sodden runways, lightning and high crosswinds, thunderstorms and low cloud ceilings – hamstrung many of NASA’s attempts to launch and land the orbiters with equal vigor. Across the 135 flights conducted between April 1981 and July 2011, around 40 percent were directly impacted by unacceptable weather either in Florida or at the Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) sites before launch and 30 percent found their launches delayed at least 24 hours as a result. Others were affected more benignly by just a handful of minutes, thanks to an initially threatening weather outlook which eventually gave way to fairer skies. Weather in Florida and California also caused several missions to be brought home earlier than intended or retained in orbit for substantially longer. In November 1994, Atlantis’ planned return to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) was switched to Edwards Air Force Base in response to predictions of gale-force winds, lashing rains and low cloud ceilings associated with Tropical Storm Gordon. And in July 1997, as the STS-94 crew prepared to return to Earth, forecasted rain in Florida dimmed their chances of an on-time landing. Against all the odds, however, conditions abruptly improved just two minutes before the deorbit burn and the Shuttle landed safely. Only weeks prior to the loss of Columbia, in December 2002, Endeavour’s return from STS-113 was delayed an astonishing three consecutive days, due to clouds, rain and high winds in Florida. Forty missions between March 1982 and September 2009 were kept in orbit at least one additional day, whilst five others between November 1981 and April 1997 were shortened by at least 24 hours owing to weather or payload-related issues.']","['Evans, Ben']",['10.1007/978-3-030-70777-4_8'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-70777-4_8'],[''],['Hard Road To Wheels Stop']

While coevolution favors the interdependence between symbiotic partners, their associations are not necessarily stable: Recently acquired symbionts can replace ancestral symbionts. In this study, we demonstrate successful replacement by Francisella -like endosymbionts (-LE), a group of B-vitamin-provisioning endosymbionts, across tick communities driven by horizontal transfers. Using a broad collection of Francisella -LE-infected tick species, we determined the diversity of Francisella -LE haplotypes through a multi-locus strain typing approach and further characterized their phylogenetic relationships and their association with biological traits of their tick hosts. The patterns observed showed that Francisella -LE commonly transfer through similar ecological networks and geographic distributions shared among different tick species and, in certain cases, through preferential shuffling across congeneric tick species. Altogether, these findings reveal the importance of geographic, ecological, and phylogenetic proximity in shaping the replacement pattern in which new nutritional symbioses are initiated.']","['Buysse, Marie, [Binetruy, Florian], [Leibson, Raz], [Gottlieb, Yuval], [Duron, Olivier]']",['10.1007/s00248-021-01773-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01773-0'],[''],['Ecological Contacts and Host Specificity Promote Replacement of Nutritional Endosymbionts in Ticks']
"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']
"['Forests in eastern North America are experiencing high densities of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and encroachment by invasive plants, both of which threaten native biodiversity. We review the literature on deer and invasive plant impacts focusing on studies that simultaneously evaluate the consequences of both. Deer have more frequent and more consistently negative effects than invasive plants. Widespread deer impacts now threaten many native plant species through much of their range. In contrast, invasive plant effects currently remain more localized and/or of smaller extent within forests. Deer impacts are also cumulative, hitting preferred plant species especially hard as they decline in density. This generates difficult-to-reverse legacy effects. Invasive plant effects, in contrast, tend to be more diffuse and may be more readily reversed. High deer populations also shift physical and chemical conditions in soils promoting “invasion cascades” involving non-native earthworms and certain introduced plants. Removing invasive plants without reducing deer populations can increase deer impacts on native species. Management should be integrated to address both deer and invasive plants. To safeguard and restore native biota when resources are limited, however, it may be most effective for managers to first reduce deer populations before investing in efforts to reduce invasive populations (except when invasions are at an early stage). We should rethink and reform traditional approaches to managing deer so that we can better integrate land vegetation with wildlife management to achieve broad public objectives.

"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']
"['In many areas of Africa, recent studies highlighted the great impact of ticks on animal and human health throughout the continent. On the other hand, very limited information on the bacterial endosymbionts of the African ticks and their pattern of co-infections with other bacteria are found in literature, notwithstanding their pivotal role in tick survival and vector efficiency. Thus, we investigated the distribution of selected pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria in hard ticks collected from wild, domestic animals and from vegetation in various ecological zones in Africa and their co-occurrence in the same tick host. Overall, 339 hard ticks were morphologically identified as belonging to\xa0the genera Amblyomma , Dermacentor , Hyalomma , Haemaphysalis, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus . Molecular screening provided information on pathogens circulation in Africa, detecting spotted fever group rickettsiae, Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia ruminantium , Borrelia garinii , Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Coxiella burnetii . Furthermore, our work provides insights on the African scenario of tick-symbiont associations, revealing the presence of Coxiella , Francisella and Midichloria across multiple tick populations. Coxiella endosymbionts were the most prevalent microorganisms, and that with the broadest spectrum of hosts, being detected in 16 tick species. Francisella was highly prevalent among the Hyalomma species tested and correlated negatively with the presence of Coxiella , showing a potential competitive interaction. Interestingly, we detected a positive association of Francisella with Rickettsia in specimens of Hy. rufipe s, suggesting a synergistic interaction between them.

"['P2 receptors are present in virtually all tissues and cell types in the human body, and they mediate the physiological and pharmacological actions of extracellular purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. They were first characterised and named by Geoff Burnstock in 1978, then subdivided into P 2X and P 2Y purinoceptors in 1985 on the basis of pharmacological criteria in functional studies on native receptors. Molecular cloning of receptors in the 1990s revealed P2X receptors to comprise seven different subunits that interact to produce functional homo- and heterotrimeric ligand-gated cation channels. A family of eight P2Y G protein–coupled receptors were also cloned, which can form homo- and heterodimers. Deep insight into the molecular mechanisms of agonist and antagonist action has been provided by more recent determination of the tertiary and quaternary structures of several P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes. Agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for individual subtypes are now available and some are in clinical use.

Unlike most other species of Araneomorphae, H. venatoria uses the great speed and strong chelicerae (mouthparts) with toxin glands to capture the insects instead of its web. Therefore, H. venatoria provides unique opportunities for venom evolution research. The venom of H. venatoria was explored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight and analyzing expressed sequence tags. The 154 sequences coding cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) revealed 24 families based on the phylogenetic analyses of precursors and cysteine frameworks in the putative mature regions.

Furthermore, combining the diverse CRPs of H. venatoria with previous spider venom peptidomics data, the structures of precursors and the patterns of cysteine frameworks were analyzed. This work revealed the dynamic evolutionary trends of venom CRPs in H. venatoria : the precursor has evolved an extended mature peptide with more cysteines, and a diminished or even vanished propeptides between the signal and mature peptides; and the CRPs evolved by multiple duplications of an ancestral ICK gene as well as recruitments of non-toxin genes.']","['Luo, Jie, [Ding, Yiying], [Peng, Zhihao], [Chen, Kezhi], [Zhang, Xuewen], [Xiao, Tiaoyi], [Chen, Jinjun]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-82668-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82668-5'],[''],['Molecular diversity and evolutionary trends of cysteine-rich peptides from the venom glands of Chinese spider Heteropoda venatoria']

Each cohort was maintained separately into the F2 generation with F1 females mating only with F1 males from their same cohort. Survival and fecundity parameters were measured for all developmental stages. The observed survival parameters for heterologous cohorts were comparable to those of the homologous cohorts through the F1 generation. However, the F1 heterologous females produced F2 egg clutches that did not hatch, thus indicating that the Arizona and Georgia populations of A. maculatum group ticks tested here represent different biological species.']","['Allerdice, Michelle E.

"['Background Pathogenic Rickettsia species belonging to the spotted fever group are arthropod-borne, obligate intracellular bacteria which exhibit preferential tropism for host microvascular endothelium in the mammalian hosts, resulting in disease manifestations attributed primarily to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Although rickettsiae are known to undergo evolution through genomic reduction, the mechanisms by which these pathogens regulate their transcriptome to ensure survival in tick vectors and maintenance by transovarial/transstadial transmission, in contrast to their ability to cause debilitating infections in human hosts remain unknown. In this study, we compare the expression profiles of rickettsial sRNAome/transcriptome and determine the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of R. conorii transcripts during in vitro infection of human and tick host cells. Results We performed deep sequencing on total RNA from Amblyomma americanum AAE2 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) infected with R. conorii . Strand-specific RNA sequencing of R. conorii transcripts revealed the expression 32 small RNAs ( Rc _sR’s), which were preferentially expressed above the limit of detection during tick cell infection, and confirmed the expression of Rc _sR61, sR71, and sR74 by quantitative RT-PCR. Intriguingly, a total of 305 and 132 R. conorii coding genes were differentially upregulated (>\u20092-fold) in AAE2 cells and HMECs, respectively. Further, enrichment for primary transcripts by treatment with Terminator 5′-Phosphate-dependent Exonuclease resulted in the identification of 3903 and 2555 transcription start sites (TSSs), including 214 and 181 primary TSSs in R. conorii during the infection to tick and human host cells, respectively. Seventy-five coding genes exhibited different TSSs depending on the host environment. Finally, we also observed differential expression of 6S RNA during host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interactions in vitro, implicating an important role for this noncoding RNA in the regulation of rickettsial transcriptome depending on the supportive host niche. Conclusions In sum, the findings of this study authenticate the presence of novel Rc _sR’s in R. conorii, reveal the first evidence for differential expression of coding transcripts and utilization of alternate transcriptional start sites depending on the host niche, and implicate a role for 6S RNA in the regulation of coding transcriptome during tripartite host-pathogen-vector interactions.']","['Narra, Hema P., [Sahni, Abha], [Alsing, Jessica], [Schroeder, Casey L.

"['Background Sand flies are the vectors of Leishmania parasites. To develop in the sand fly midgut, Leishmania multiplies and undergoes various stage differentiations giving rise to the infective form, the metacyclic promastigotes. To determine the changes in sand fly midgut gene expression caused by the presence of Leishmania , we performed RNA-Seq of uninfected and Leishmania infantum -infected Lutzomyia longipalpis midguts from seven different libraries corresponding to time points which cover the various Leishmania developmental stages. Results The combined transcriptomes resulted in the de novo assembly of 13,841 sand fly midgut transcripts. Importantly, only 113 sand fly transcripts, about 1%, were differentially expressed in the presence of Leishmania parasites. Further, we observed distinct differentially expressed sand fly midgut transcripts corresponding to the presence of each of the various Leishmania stages suggesting that each parasite stage influences midgut gene expression in a specific manner. Two main patterns of sand fly gene expression modulation were noted. At early time points (days 1–4), more transcripts were down-regulated by Leishmania infection at large fold changes (>\u200932 fold). Among the down-regulated genes, the transcription factor Forkhead/HNF-3 and hormone degradation enzymes were differentially regulated on day 2 and appear to be the upstream regulators of nutrient transport, digestive enzymes, and peritrophic matrix proteins. Conversely, at later time points (days 6 onwards), most of the differentially expressed transcripts were up-regulated by Leishmania infection with small fold changes (<\u200932 fold). The molecular functions of these genes have been associated with the metabolism of lipids and detoxification of xenobiotics. Conclusion Overall, our data suggest that the presence of Leishmania produces a limited change in the midgut transcript expression profile in sand flies. Further, Leishmania modulates sand fly gene expression early on in the developmental cycle in order to overcome the barriers imposed by the midgut, yet it behaves like a commensal at later time points where a massive number of parasites in the anterior midgut results only in modest changes in midgut gene expression.']","['Coutinho-Abreu, Iliano V., [Serafim, Tiago Donatelli], [Meneses, Claudio], [Kamhawi, Shaden], [Oliveira, Fabiano], [Valenzuela, Jesus G.]']",['10.1186/s12864-020-07025-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07025-8'],[''],['Leishmania infection induces a limited differential gene expression in the sand fly midgut']

"['Background The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus , is a highly dangerous invasive vector of numerous medically important arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. In four decades it has spread from tropical Southeast Asia to many parts of the world in both tropical and temperate climes. The rapid invasion process of this mosquito is supported by its high ecological and genetic plasticity across different life history traits. Our aim was to investigate whether wild populations, both native and adventive, also display transcriptional genetic variability for functions that may impact their biology, behaviour and ability to transmit arboviruses, such as sensory perception. Results Antennal transcriptome data were derived from mosquitoes from a native population from Ban Rai, Thailand and from three adventive Mediterranean populations: Athens, Greece and Arco and Trento from Italy. Clear inter-population differential transcriptional activity was observed in different gene categories related to sound perception, olfaction and viral infection. The greatest differences were detected between the native Thai and the Mediterranean populations. The two Italian populations were the most similar. Nearly one million quality filtered SNP loci were identified. Conclusion The ability to express this great inter-population transcriptional variability highlights, at the functional level, the remarkable genetic flexibility of this mosquito species. We can hypothesize that the differential expression of genes, including those involved in sensory perception, in different populations may enable Ae. albopictus to exploit different environments and hosts, thus contributing to its status as a global vector of arboviruses of public health importance. The large number of SNP loci present in these transcripts represents a useful addition to the arsenal of high-resolution molecular markers and a resource that can be used to detect selective pressure and adaptive changes that may have occurred during the colonization process.']","['Gomulski, Ludvik M., [Manni, Mosè], [Carraretto, Davide], [Nolan, Tony], [Lawson, Daniel], [Ribeiro, José M.], [Malacrida, Anna R.], [Gasperi, Giuliano]']",['10.1186/s12864-020-06956-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06956-6'],[''],['Transcriptional variation of sensory-related genes in natural populations of Aedes albopictus']

"['The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus , is a monoxenous tick that co-evolved with indicine cattle on the Indian subcontinent. It causes massive damage to livestock worldwide. Cattle breeds present heritable, contrasting phenotypes of tick loads, taurine breeds carrying higher loads of the parasite than indicine breeds. Thus, a useful model is available to analyze mechanisms that determine outcomes of parasitism. We sought to gain insights on these mechanisms and used RNA sequencing and Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) to generate a transcriptome from whole larvae and salivary glands from nymphs, males and females feeding on genetically susceptible and resistant bovine hosts and their corresponding proteomes. 931,698 reads were annotated into 11,676 coding sequences (CDS), which were manually curated into 116 different protein families. Male ticks presented the most diverse armamentarium of mediators of parasitism. In addition, levels of expression of many genes encoding mediators of parasitism were significantly associated with the level and stage of host immunity and/or were temporally restricted to developmental stages of the tick.

"['Background Assessing the burden of rickettsial infections in Ontario, Canada, is challenging since rickettsial infections are not reportable to public health. In the absence of reportable disease data, we assessed the burden of rickettsial infections by examining patient serological data and clinical information. Methods Our retrospective, cross-sectional study included patients who had Rickettsia serological testing ordered by their physician, in Ontario, from 2013 to 2018. We tested sera from 2755 non-travel patients for antibodies against spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and typhus group rickettsiae (TGR) using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (positive IgG titers ≥1:64). We classified cases using a sensitive surveillance case definition: confirmed (4-fold increase in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera with clinical evidence of infection), possible (single positive sera with clinical evidence) and previous rickettsial infection (single positive sera without clinical evidence). We classified cases seropositive for both SFGR and TGR as unspecified Rickettsia infections (URIs). Results Less than 5% of all patients had paired acute and convalescent sera tested, and of these, we found a single, laboratory-confirmed SFGR case, with a 4-fold increase in IgG titers and evidence of fever, maculopapular rash and headache. There were 45 possible (19 SFGR, 7 TGR, 19 URI) and 580 previous rickettsial infection (183 SFGR, 89 TGR, 308 URI) cases. The rate of positive tests for SFGR, TGR and URI combined (all case classifications) were 4.4 per 100,000 population. For confirmed and possible cases, the most common signs and symptoms were fever, headache, gastrointestinal complaints and maculopapular rash. The odds of having seropositive patients increased annually by 30% (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.39). Conclusions The rates of rickettsial infections in Ontario are difficult to determine. Based on confirmed and possible cases, rates are low, but inclusion of previous rickettsial infection cases would indicate higher rates. We highlight the need for education regarding the importance of testing acute and convalescent sera and consistent completion of the laboratory requisition in confirming rickettsial disease. We suggest further research in Ontario to investigate rickettsial agents in potential vectors and clinical studies employing PCR testing of clinical samples.']","['Nelder, Mark P., [Russell, Curtis B.], [Johnson, Steven], [Li, Ye], [Cronin, Kirby], [Warshawsky, Bryna], [Brandon, Nicholas], [Patel, Samir N.]']",['10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],[''],"['Assessing human exposure to spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae in Ontario, Canada (2013–2018): a retrospective, cross-sectional study']"

"['Background The castor bean tick Ixodes ricinus is an important vector of several clinically important diseases, whose prevalence increases with accelerating global climate changes. Characterization of a tick life-cycle is thus of great importance. However, researchers mainly focus on specific organs of fed life stages, while early development of this tick species is largely neglected. Methods In an attempt to better understand the life-cycle of this widespread arthropod parasite, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four life stages (egg, larva, nymph and adult female), including unfed and partially blood-fed individuals. To enable a more reliable identification of transcripts and their comparison in all five transcriptome libraries, we validated an improved-fit set of five I. ricinus -specific reference genes for internal standard normalization of our transcriptomes. Then, we mapped biological functions to transcripts identified in different life stages (clusters) to elucidate life stage-specific processes. Finally, we drew conclusions from the functional enrichment of these clusters specifically assigned to each transcriptome, also in the context of recently published transcriptomic studies in ticks. Results We found that reproduction-related transcripts are present in both fed nymphs and fed females, underlining the poorly documented importance of ovaries as moulting regulators in ticks. Additionally, we identified transposase transcripts in tick eggs suggesting elevated transposition during embryogenesis, co-activated with factors driving developmental regulation of gene expression. Our findings also highlight the importance of the regulation of energetic metabolism in tick eggs during embryonic development and glutamate metabolism in nymphs. Conclusions Our study presents novel insights into stage-specific transcriptomes of I. ricinus and extends the current knowledge of this medically important pathogen, especially in the early phases of its development.']","['Vechtova, Pavlina, [Fussy, Zoltan], [Cegan, Radim], [Sterba, Jan], [Erhart, Jan], [Benes, Vladimir], [Grubhoffer, Libor]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04173-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04173-4'],[''],['Catalogue of stage-specific transcripts in Ixodes ricinus and their potential functions during the tick life-cycle']

We used a set of 4,764 records of ticks of the genera Amblyomma , Ixodes , and Haemaphysalis and their hosts in the Neotropics to approach the tick-host relationships using a network-based construct. The network identified 9 clusters of interacting hosts and ticks partially connected by 22 tick species that switch their host range according to their life cycle stage. These links among clusters do not confer an extra resilience to the network following removal of hosts and subsequent cascade extinctions of ticks: the robustness of the network slightly changed when these inter-clusters links are considered. Phylogenetic clustering of ticks to hosts at cluster level was not significant (p\u2009>\u20090.15) but if examined individually 63 tick species/stages (59%) displayed such clustering, suggesting that their hosts have a related phylogenetic background. We interpreted these results under an ecological perspective in which ticks could track its environmental niche associating to vertebrates that would maximize tick survival under the range of abiotic traits.

"['Background Cercopithifilaria bainae is a filarioid nematode of dogs. Infection with the parasite was not reported in the USA until 2017, when a dog with skin lesions in Florida was diagnosed. Brown dog ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus ( sensu lato ), are the purported tick vectors, and are widespread in the USA. Therefore, C. bainae is likely present in additional states. Here, we tested dogs and ticks in Oklahoma for evidence of C. bainae infection. Methods Dermal punch biopsies were opportunistically collected from municipal shelter and client-owned dogs. Multiple skin samples collected from interscapular and head regions were tested by saline sedimentation to recover live microfilariae for morphometric identification and by PCR to amplify a 330 bp region of the filarioid 12S rRNA gene. Also, ticks observed on surveyed dogs were collected, identified to species level, and tested for filarioid DNA. Results A total of 496 saline sedimentations were performed on 230 shelter and 20 client-owned dogs. Cercopithifilaria bainae infections were identified in 2.6% (6/230) of shelter dogs by morphometry of microfilariae in sedimentations and/or amplification of DNA from skin. DNA sequences amplified from PCR positive skin samples were 99–100% identical to C. bainae reported in Italy. All skin samples from client-owned dogs were negative for filarioid infection by saline sedimentation and PCR. A total of 112 ticks, comprised of four species, were collected. Two of 72 R. sanguineus ( s.l .), both engorged females found attached to a C. bainae infected dog, harbored C. bainae DNA (99–100% identity). One attached R. sanguineus ( s.l .) male on the same dog harbored filarioid DNA sequence which was difficult to interpret at numerous base-pair locations, but was closest in identity (~80%) to C. bainae . Conclusions The distribution of C. bainae is more widespread than previously known.

At necropsy, half of the heart, lung, liver, spleen and kidneys were collected from each animal. The presence of Babesia DNA targeting the 18S rRNA gene was evaluated from blood and tissues samples. For histopathology, the other halves of the tissues were used. Stained blood smears were used for the light microscopy detection of Babesia . Results From the 15 pools of D. reticulatus used for the oral inoculation, six were PCR-positive for B. canis . DNA of B. canis was detected in blood and tissues of 33.3% of the animals (4 out of 12) inoculated with a B. canis- positive pool. No Babesia DNA was detected in the other 18 animals which received B. canis -negative tick pools. No Babesia was detected during the histological examination and all blood smears were microscopically negative. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that B. canis DNA can be detected in tissues of mammalian hosts following ingestion of infected ticks and opens the question of alternative transmission routes for piroplasms.']","['Corduneanu, Alexandra, [Ursache, Teodor Dan], [Taulescu, Marian], [Sevastre, Bogdan], [Modrý, David], [Mihalca, Andrei Daniel]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04051-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04051-z'],[''],['Detection of DNA of Babesia canis in tissues of laboratory rodents following oral inoculation with infected ticks']
"['Zoonotic tick-borne diseases, including those caused by Rickettsia species, continue to have serious consequences for public health worldwide. One such disease that has emerged as a major problem in several countries of the American continent is the Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii . Several tick species are capable of transmitting R. rickettsia, including Amblyomma cajennense, A. aureolatum, A. imitator, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor andersoni, D. variabilis and possibly A. americanum. Despite previous reports in Mexico linking new outbreaks of RMSF to the presence of these tick species, no robust measures have tackled transmission. In the present study, we amplified R. rickettsii from 109 test DNA samples extracted from ticks collected from several animals and humans of Tamaulipas, Mexico, between November 2015 and December 2017. Our analysis revealed the presence of R. rickettsii in six samples and these findings contribute to a spatial distribution map that is intended to minimize the risk of transmission to humans.']","['Merino, O., [Cruz, N.

Methods Laboratory studies were conducted against two different strains of each tick species. In each study, 10 purpose-bred Beagle or mixed-breed dogs were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups based on pre-treatment host-suitability tick counts. Dogs were infested with approximately 50 (45–55) unfed adult ticks on Days -2, 5, 12, 19, 26 and 33. On Day 0, dogs received either a single oral dose of Simparica Trio™ at the minimum label dose of 1.2 mg/kg sarolaner, 24 µg/kg moxidectin and 5 mg/kg pyrantel (as pamoate salt) or placebo. Tick counts were conducted at 48 h post-treatment and after each subsequent weekly re-infestation for A. maculatum , D. variabilis , I. scapularis and R. sanguineus studies and at 48 hours or at 72 h post-treatment and after weekly re-infestation in the first and second A. americanum studies, respectively. Results No treatment-related adverse reactions occurred in any study. In all studies, placebo-treated dogs maintained infestations throughout the entire study duration, and dogs treated with Simparica Trio™ had significantly lower ( P ≤ 0.0010) mean live tick counts than placebo-treated dogs at all time-points. Against A. maculatum , D. variabilis , I. scapularis and R. sanguineus , a single oral dose of Simparica Trio™ evaluated at 48 h post-treatment provided ≥ 98.9% efficacy against existing infestations, and within 48 h of re-infestation efficacy was ≥ 90.4% through at least Day 28 (except for R . sanguineus on Day 14 in a single study with an efficacy of 89.7%).

"['We studied ptyctimous moss mites, which are characteristic of forest habitats, in Norwegian broadleaf forests considered as biodiversity hotspot areas in Fennoscandia. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of different factors (regional locality, annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest type, forest wetness and microhabitat) on the ptyctimous mites and on discovering their richness in broadleaf forests. Samples were collected from nine broadleaf forests in Western, Southern and Eastern Norway, in different climatic conditions, six forest types, three forest wetness states and eight microhabitats. Overall, 3341 ptyctimous mites were collected and their abundance differed significantly among the regions, forest types and microhabitats. Forest type turned out to be the most important factor, responsible for 24.5% of the total variation in the abundance of the ptyctimous mites. Other important factors were forest wetness and microhabitat. In total, 27 species, i.e., 87% of all ptyctimous mites known from before in Norway were found and the species richness was highest in the east and lowest in the west of the country. Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus was most common and most abundant; it made nearly 30% of all ptyctimous mites collected. On the other hand, a quarter of the species were represented by less than 10 specimens; most of these were new records for Norway. Among ten species discovered as new to Norway, four were also new to Fennoscandia.

Using a broad collection of Francisella -LE-infected tick species, we determined the diversity of Francisella -LE haplotypes through a multi-locus strain typing approach and further characterized their phylogenetic relationships and their association with biological traits of their tick hosts. The patterns observed showed that Francisella -LE commonly transfer through similar ecological networks and geographic distributions shared among different tick species and, in certain cases, through preferential shuffling across congeneric tick species.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s).

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

The study examinated also the effect of some host parameters (age, sex, size, body condition), in addition to the season and altitude on the prevalence and intensity of parasite infestations. The study was conducted in three localities from May to September 2019. The results indicated that 35% of juvenile geckos were found to be parasited by one type of parasite. Contrarily, up to three types of parasites were detected in the adults. The prevalence of mite infestations was 48.02%, with a mean intensity of 11.80 ± 15.69. The patterns of mite infestations was found to be mainly related to the altitude, while the prevalence and intensity of infestations were linked to the host size, and to the sex and season, respectively. Larvae and nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758) were the only life stages infesting geckos, with a prevalence and mean intensity of infestations of 4.41% and 2.2 ± 1.48, respectively.

"['We studied a group of tick-associated viruses with characteristics of members of the family Iflaviridae , a family of viruses frequently found in arthropods. Our aim was to gain insight into the evolutionary dynamics of this group of viruses, which may be linked to the biology of ticks. We explored assembled RNA-Seq data sets for different species of ticks. We identified members of five different iflavirus species, four of them novel, and discovered nine new genome sequences, including variants. Five variants represented a virus species associated with Ixodes ricinus . Unexpectedly, a sequence found in the Ixodes scapularis cell line ISE6 was nearly identical to the sequences of\xa0 I. ricinus variants, suggesting a contamination of this cell line by I. ricinus material.

"['Contrary to the early evidence, which indicated that the mitochondrial architecture in one of the two major annelida clades, Sedentaria, is relatively conserved, a handful of relatively recent studies found evidence that some species exhibit elevated rates of mitochondrial architecture evolution. We sequenced complete mitogenomes belonging to two congeneric shell-boring Spionidae species that cause considerable economic losses in the commercial marine mollusk aquaculture: Polydora brevipalpa and Polydora websteri . The two mitogenomes exhibited very similar architecture. In comparison to other sedentarians, they exhibited some standard features, including all genes encoded on the same strand, uncommon but not unique duplicated trnM gene, as well as a number of unique features. Their comparatively large size (17,673\xa0bp) can be attributed to four non-coding regions larger than 500\xa0bp. We identified an unusually large (putative) overlap of 14 bases between nad2 and cox1 genes in both species. Importantly, the two species exhibited completely rearranged gene orders in comparison to all other available mitogenomes. Along with Serpulidae and Sabellidae, Polydora is the third identified sedentarian lineage that exhibits disproportionally elevated rates of mitogenomic architecture rearrangements.

"['Background Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) belongs to the genus Orthonairovirus ( Nairovididae ) and is a (re)emerging tick-borne pathogen. It is endemic in most parts of Africa, Asia and southern Europe, and can cause severe hemorrhagic symptoms in humans, with high fatality rates (5–30%). Methods Hyalomma ticks were collected from four different livestock herds (cattle and camels) in Mauritania in 2018. The tick species were determined morphologically and confirmed molecularly by using the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene marker. For the detection of CCHFV, ticks were tested individually by one-step multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The small segment of all positive samples was sequenced to determine the CCHFV genotype. Results In total, 39 of the 1523 ticks (2.56%) collected from 63 cattles and 28 camels tested positive for CCHFV. Three Hyalomma species were identified. Hyalomma rufipes had the largest proportion of positivity (5.67%; 16/282), followed by Hyalomma dromedarii (1.89%; 23/1214). No Hyalomma impeltatum tested positive (0%; 0/21). Positive ticks were found in only six out of 91 host animals. Viral sequence analysis revealed the presence of two different CCHFV lineages (Africa I and Africa\xa0III). Conclusions In this study, 2.56% of Hyalomma ticks collected from camels and cattle in Mauritania tested positive for CCHFV. However, the true prevalence of CCHFV in unfed ticks may be lower, as a considerable number of ticks may have been passively infected during blood-feeding by co-feeding ticks or due to viremia of the host. The results indicate the need to track the actual area of circulation of this virus. Graphic Abstract']","['Schulz, A., [Barry, Y.], [Stoek, F.], [Pickin, M.

"['Background Birds are major hosts for many tick species (Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and their role is especially important in transporting ticks over large distances along their seasonal migratory routes. Accordingly, most studies across Europe focus on the importance of avian hosts in tick dispersal, and less emphasis is laid on resident birds and their role in supporting tick life cycles. Eurasian eagle owls ( Bubo bubo ) exemplify the latter, but all the few studies on their tick infestation were carried out in Western Europe and even those did not involve a large sample size and did not assess infestation prevalence in natural habitats. Methods In this study, 320 ixodid ticks were collected from nestlings of Eurasian eagle owls during the period 2018–2020 in Bulgaria in south-eastern Europe. These ticks were analysed morphologically, and selected specimens molecularly based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( cox 1) gene. The effects of environmental and habitat-related conditions and of the species of prey eaten by eagle owls on tick infestation were also evaluated. Results The majority of ticks were identified as adults of Rhipicephalus turanicus ( n \u2009=\u2009296). In addition, 15 Hyalomma marginatum (three males, 11 nymphs and a larva), one female of Haemaphysalis erinacei and of Ha. punctata , and a nymph of Ixodes ricinus were found. Among R. turanicus , two distinct morphotypes were observed, but they do not form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial gene cox1. We found a positive correlation between the total number of ticks on nestlings from a particular nest and the number of medium-sized to large prey mammals brought to the nestling owls. Also, the most important predictor for tick abundance was the effect of the extent of arable land (negative), while forests and grasslands contributed less, with no effect observed in case of urbanized areas and watercourses. Conclusions The intensity of tick infestation can be high on nestling Eurasian eagle owls (mean intensity 16.59\xa0ticks/nestling). In this study, five different tick species were recorded, among which R. turanicus dominated. Two male morphotypes of this tick species were found, but their morphological differences were not reflected by genetic diversity or phylogenetic clustering. The most important factor determining tick abundance was the land-use structure.

"['In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape.']","['Conte, Christine E., [Leahy, Jessica E.], [Gardner, Allison M.]']",['10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],[''],['Active Forest Management Reduces Blacklegged Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Exposure Risk']

"['Background Improved knowledge on vector-borne pathogens in wildlife will help determine their effect on host species at the population and individual level and whether these are affected by anthropogenic factors such as global climate change and landscape changes. Here, samples from brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea ) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta ) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA ( n \u2009=\u200917), SHNA ( n \u2009=\u200919) and SHTZ ( n \u2009=\u200925) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau -like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum / platys -like and Anaplasma bovis -like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau -like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus ). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli -like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis -like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1–4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2–4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0–4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia , multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group.

"['The homology of the arachnid chelicera with respect to other head appendages in Panarthropoda has long been debated. Gene expression data and the re-interpretation of early transitional fossils have supported the homology of the deutocerebrum and its associated appendages, implying a homology between primary antennae (mandibulates), chelicerae (euchelicerates), and chelifores (sea spiders). Nevertheless, comparatively little is known about the mechanistic basis of proximo-distal (PD) axis induction in chelicerates, much less the basis for cheliceral fate specification. Here, we describe a new cheliceral teratology in the spider Tetragnatha versicolor Walckenaer, 1841, which consists on a duplication of the PD axis of the left chelicera associated with a terminal secondary schistomely on the fang of the lower axis. This duplication offers clues as to potential shared mechanisms of PD axis formation in the chelicera. We review the state of knowledge on PD axis induction mechanisms in arthropods and identify elements of gene regulatory networks that are key for future functional experiments of appendage development in non-insect model systems. Such investigations would allow a better understanding of PD axis induction of modified and poorly studied arthropod limbs (e.g., chelicerae, chelifores, and ovigers).']","['Cotoras, Darko D., [Castanheira, Pedro de S.], [Sharma, Prashant P.]']",['10.1007/s00427-021-00678-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-021-00678-9'],[''],['Implications of a cheliceral axial duplication in Tetragnatha versicolor (Araneae: Tetragnathidae) for arachnid deuterocerebral appendage development']

Phylogenetic analyses including 16S rDNA partial sequences of different Ornithodoros taxa from Central and South America indicate that O. rondoniensis from Brazil diverges from O. clarki from Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama. However, phylogenetic distance separating both alleged species is similar or slightly lower than the distances depicted for conspecific populations of a few other Ornithodoros species.

"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']
"['The yellow banded wasp, Vespa cincta F. is one of the most destructive pests of honeybee colonies in India. Despite high species richness, there is diminutive information on the intraspecific variations occurring in the wasp from different geographical regions. The present study was undertaken to ascertain if any intraspecific variability existed in populations of V. cincta from four geographical regions of Assam, India. The adult specimens from each region were studied using 24 morphological characters, as well as with genetic markers subjected to PCR. No significant variation was recorded for 15 morphological characters; however, nine characters viz., body length, thorax length and width, mandible length and width, fore wing width, fore leg width, hind leg width, and sting width were significantly larger in specimens collected from Barak Valley and Hill Zone (BVHZ) as compared to specimens from Upper Brahmaputra Valley Zone (UBVZ), Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone (LBVZ) and North Bank Plain Zone (NBPZ). Variability in morphometrics further revealed that species from UPVZ, LBVZ, and NBPZ occupied similar positions, with a clear distinction from the species of BVHZ. Molecular analyses further supplemented this information with the SSR based dendrogram readily separating V. cincta into two main clusters, A and B. Cluster A included the species from LBVZ, NBPZ, and UBVZ while cluster B comprised of species from BVHZ only. Within NBPZ, specimens from Nagaon and Morigaon regions differed to some extent from specimens of other regions. Specimens of Jorhat region of UBVZ were found to more closely related to specimens of Sonitpur region of NBPZ while specimens of Golaghat region of UBVZ formed a separate sub-cluster with specimens of Karbi Anglong region of BVHZ. The present findings suggest that intraspecific diversity in V . cincta could be a result of variation in evolutionary lineage as well as environmental aspects of their bio-geographical area of origin.']","['Rajkhowa, Denisha, [Deka, Mukul Kumar], [Bora, Basanta], [Devee, Anjumoni], [Rahman, Ataur]']",['10.1007/s42690-020-00357-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00357-8'],[''],"['Comparative analysis of intraspecific variability in yellow banded wasp, Vespa cincta F.

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']
"['Purpose In order to determine the interactive effect of Phyllostachys pubescens (moso bamboo) expansion to adjacent coniferous forest ( Cryptomeria japonica , Japanese cedar) on soil fauna communities and soil food web, we conducted a tangible investigation combined with natural abundance isotope analysis to examine how moso bamboo expansion process affects soil faunal composition and underground soil food web in Lushan mountain, southeast China. Methods Exact treatments are as follows: (1) moso bamboo forest, (2) ecotone area and (3) Japanese cedar forest. We collected 74 arthropod groups from the field. Results The groups of Acari and Collembola were the two main soil fauna taxa with the highest abundance which accounted for 18.86–98.9% of the relative total abundance among various habitats. Peak of soil faunal density in moso bamboo and Japanese cedar forests appeared in May and November. Soil fauna community in ecotone was more similar to that in moso bamboo forest, indicating that the expansion process was still in infancy stage, and there was no significant difference in soil fauna community diversity index among the three forest types. Moso bamboo expansion did not affect the nutrient level of Collembola and Oribatida, but decreased that of Megsostigmata. The nutrient level of Hymenoptera and Coleoptera increased in ecotone, and Diptera kept in the third nutrient level in all three forest types, while the Hemiptera, Araneida and Pseudo-scorpionidea remained at a high level. Conclusion The results demonstrated that in moso bamboo expansion process, soil fauna groups with low nutrient levels were more affected, while the soil faunas with high nutrient level were less affected.']","['Liu, Wei, [Liao, Liqin], [Liu, Yuanqiu], [Wang, Qiong], [Murray, Philip J.], [Jiang, Xueru], [Zou, Guiwu], [Cai, Junhuo], [Zhao, Xiaomin]']",['10.1007/s11368-021-02923-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-021-02923-0'],[''],"['Effects of Phyllostachys pubescens expansion on underground soil fauna community and soil food web in a Cryptomeria japonica plantation, Lushan Mountain, subtropical China']"

In this study, we investigated the presence of Ixodiphagus hookeri in Haemaphysalis concinna and Ixodes ricinus ticks in the Slovak Karst (southern Slovakia) and analysed the ecological and physiological relationships in the parasitoid-host system. Unfed H. concinna and I. ricinus nymphs harvested from vegetation were fed on rabbits. The engorged specimens were kept at 25\xa0°C and 75% RH until the emergence of the adult wasps. For the first time in Europe, we found the presence of I. hookeri in two species of ticks collected in the same locality and compared their development in these tick species. The prevalence of wasps in H. concinna and I. ricinus during their spring activity was estimated at 10.64% and 27.78%, respectively. The presence of the wasps did not affect the duration of nymph feeding. Engorged wasp-infected ticks achieved higher body mass than non-infected specimens. In both tick species, there were no differences in the length of the development period and the number and sex ratio of adult I. hookeri .

"['Background The emergence of tick-borne disease is increasing because of the effects of the temperature rise driven by global warming. In Turkey, 19 pathogens transmitted by ticks to humans and animals have been reported. Based on this, this study aimed to investigate tick-borne pathogens including Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., and Bartonella spp. in tick samples ( n = 110) collected from different hosts (dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, and turtles) by molecular methods. Methods To meet this objective, ticks were identified morphologically at the genus level by microscopy; after DNA isolation, each tick sample was identified at the species level using the molecular method. Involved pathogens were then investigated by PCR method. Results Seven different tick species were identified including Rhipicephalus sanguineus , R. turanicus , R. bursa , Hyalomma marginatum , H. anatolicum , H. aegyptium , and Haemaphysalis erinacei . Among the analyzed ticks, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp., Babesia spp., and Anaplasma spp. were detected at rates of 6.36%, 16.3%, 1.81%, and 6.36%, respectively while Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp. were not detected.

"['Background The significance of tick-borne diseases has increased considerably in recent years. Because of the unique distribution of the tick species Dermacentor reticulatus in Poland, comprising two expanding populations, Eastern and Western that are separated by a Dermacentor -free zone, it is important to conduct studies on the process of tick expansion and emergence of canine babesiosis. The main aim of the current study was to monitor the expansion of D. reticulatus populations from spring 2016 to autumn 2018 to determine (1) the actual geographical range of this tick species, and (2) and the seasonal/annual shift in range limits and changes in distance between Western and Eastern populations of ticks (the size of the non-endemic area). Methods Ticks were collected in spring/autumn during a 3-year study. From each season and year at least three pairs of sites from the Western and Eastern populations were selected. Then the mean distance between paired sites was calculated for each season and year. We collected and analyzed data from veterinary clinics on the number of canine babesiosis cases treated in the clinic during a whole year (2018). Results Accordingly, further expansion of the two D. reticulatus populations was recorded, mainly along river basins. Marked colonization of the gap zone was observed, with a mean annual shift in the range of 2.5–10 km and a steadily decreasing distance between the two tick populations. The occurrence of babesiosis in different regions revealed low numbers of cases in Western Poland (19 cases/year) and the gap area (only 7 cases/year) and high incidence (up to 250 cases/1000 dogs) and fatality (total 3.65%) in Central and Eastern Poland. Strong associations were found geographically between tick and babesiosis occurrence and temporally in the seasonal patterns of occurrence of ticks and outbreaks of babesiosis. Conclusions We documented the shift in range limits and continued process of colonization of the gap zone accompanied by the emergence of canine babesiosis in the Eastern expansion zone. Updated maps of the distribution of ticks and occurrence of babesiosis in different regions of Poland have allowed us to predict of the emergence of pathogens vectored by D. reticulatus.

"['Background In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n \u2009=\u200929), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n \u2009=\u20096), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n \u2009=\u200914) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n \u2009=\u200917) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']

Herein, we studied the seasonal dynamics of A. sculptum in an urban area of the Cerrado biome in midwestern Brazil, where human rickettsiosis is endemic. Ticks were collected in two sites located within the campus of Federal University of Goiás. The collections were done by dragging, flagging and visual search.

"['Background Cattle fever ticks (CFT), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus and R . ( B .) microplus , are vectors of microbes causing bovine babesiosis and pose a threat to the economic viability of the US livestock industry. Efforts by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) along the US-Mexico border in south Texas are complicated by the involvement of alternate hosts, including white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus ). Methods In the present study, we use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore the potential effects of host species composition and host habitat use patterns on southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R . ( B .) microplus ) infestation dynamics and efficacy of eradication schemes. Results In simulations without eradication efforts, mean off-host larval densities were much higher when cattle were present than when only white-tailed deer and nilgai were present. Densities in mesquite and meadows were slightly higher, and densities in mixed brush were much lower, than landscape-level densities in each of these scenarios. In eradication simulations, reductions in mean off-host larval densities at the landscape level were much smaller when acaricide was applied to cattle only, or to cattle and white-tailed deer, than when applied to cattle and nilgai. Relative density reductions in mesquite, mixed brush, and meadows depended on host habitat use preferences. Shifting nilgai habitat use preferences increasingly toward mixed brush and away from mesquite did not change mean off-host larval tick densities noticeably at the landscape level. However, mean densities were increased markedly in mesquite and decreased markedly in mixed brush, while no noticeable change in density was observed in meadows. Conclusions Our results suggest that continued integration of field data into spatially explicit, individual-based models will facilitate the development of novel eradication strategies and will allow near-real-time infestation forecasts as an aid in anticipating and preventing wildlife-mediated impacts on SCFT eradication efforts.']","['Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan, [Grant, William E.], [Teel, Pete D.], [Lohmeyer, Kimberly H.], [Pérez de León, Adalberto A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04724-3'],[''],"['Simulated dynamics of southern cattle fever ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) in south Texas, USA: investigating potential wildlife-mediated impacts on eradication efforts']"

In the ticks, we found the DNA of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma platys , and Ehrlichia sp. The results of this study indicate that R. microplus was introduced into Guinea in association with cows from Mali and/or the Ivory Coast.']","['Makenov, Marat T., [Toure, Aboubakar H.], [Korneev, Mikhail G.], [Sacko, Noumany], [Porshakov, Aleksander M.], [Yakovlev, Sergey A.], [Radyuk, Ekaterina V.], [Zakharov, Kirill S.], [Shipovalov, Andrey V.], [Boumbaly, Sanaba], [Zhurenkova, Olga B.], [Grigoreva, Yana E.], [Morozkin, Evgeny S.], [Fyodorova, Marina V.], [Boiro, Mamadou Y.], [Karan, Lyudmila S.]']",['10.1007/s00436-021-07122-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07122-x'],[''],['Rhipicephalus microplus and its vector-borne haemoparasites in Guinea: further species expansion in West Africa']
"['Repetitive DNAs comprise large portion of eukaryote genomes. In genome projects, the assembly of repetitive DNAs is challenging due to the similarity between repeats, which generate ambiguities for alignment. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for the physical mapping of various sequences on chromosomes. This technique is thus very helpful in chromosome-based genome assemblies, providing information on the fine architecture of genomes and their evolution. However, various protocols are currently used for FISH mapping, most of which are relatively laborious and expensive, or work properly only with a specific type of probes or sequences, and there is a need for a universal and affordable FISH protocol. Here we tested a FISH protocol for mapping of different DNA repeats, such as multigene families (rDNAs, U snDNAs, histone genes), satellite DNAs, microsatellites, transposable elements, DOP-PCR products, and telomeric motif (TTAGG) n , on the chromosomes of various insects and other arthropods. Different cell types and stages obtained from diverse tissues were used. The FISH procedure proved high quality and reliable results in all experiments performed. We obtained data on the chromosomal distribution of DNA repeats in representatives of insects and other arthropods. Thus, our results allow us to conclude that the protocol is universal and requires only time adjustment for chromosome/DNA denaturation. The use of this FISH protocol will facilitate studies focused on understanding the evolution and role of repetitive DNA in arthropod genomes.']","['Cabral-de-Mello, Diogo Cavalcanti, [Marec, František]']",['10.1007/s00438-021-01765-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-021-01765-2'],[''],['Universal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol for mapping repetitive DNAs in insects and other arthropods']
"['Bird and mammal nests provide microhabitats that support a range of other species, including invertebrates. However, the variation between communities of nest-dwelling invertebrates in different nests is poorly understood. The major aim of this study was to analyze the assemblage structure of mites from the suborder Uropodina (Acari: Mesostigmata) and from superfamily Crotonioidea (Acari: Oribatida) inhabiting nests of the wood warbler, Phylloscopus sibilatrix (Aves: Passeriformes), located on a forest floor in Białowieża Forest, in eastern Poland.

In 2019, immediately after the breeding period, 69 wood warbler nests and 439 soil samples were collected. Analyses revealed assemblages of Uropodina mites inhabiting the nests that consisted of 14 species, mostly common soil species. Only five species of oribatid mites from superfamily Crotonioidea were present in the nest material. Analyzed nests had a high percentage of tree leaves and grass blades, whereas moss was the least frequent component of the nest material. The Uropodina mites were more abundant in the nests that had greater amounts of grass blades, but similar relationships were insignificant for the nests with varying amounts of tree leaves or moss. The assemblages of Uropodina mites inhabiting wood warbler nests were very similar to those found in soil and nests of the common mole, but they lacked typical nest-dwelling species of Uropodina (i.e., specialized nidicoles).']","['Napierała, Agnieszka, [Maziarz, Marta], [Hebda, Grzegorz], [Broughton, Richard K.], [Rutkowski, Tomasz], [Zacharyasiewicz, Michał], [Błoszyk, Jerzy]']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00620-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00620-8'],[''],"['Lack of specialist nidicoles as a characteristic of mite assemblages inhabiting nests of the ground-nesting wood warbler, Phylloscopus sibilatrix (Aves: Passeriformes)']"

"['Background The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of Sarcoptiformes mites typically contain 37 genes. Although the loss of genes is rare in Sarcoptiformes mite mitogenomes, two of the six previously reported oribatid mites (Acariforms: Sarcoptiformes) are reported to have lost parts of their tRNA genes. To confirm whether the tRNA genes were indeed lost and whether the loss is universal, we re-annotated the available oribatid mite sequences and sequenced the mitogenome of Oribatula sakamorii . Methods The mitogenome of O . sakamorii was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. The mt tRNA gene was annotated using multi-software combined with a manual annotation approach. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods with concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Results The mitogenomes of O . sakamorii contained 37 genes, including 22 tRNA genes. We identified all mt tRNA genes that were reported as “lost” in Steganacarus magnus and Paraleius leontonychus and revealed certain atypical tRNA annotation errors in oribatid mite sequences. Oribatid mite mitogenomes are characterized by low rates of genetic rearrangement, with six or seven gene blocks conserved between the mitogenome of all species and that of ancestral arthropods. Considering the relative order of the major genes (protein-coding genes and rRNAs), only one or two genes were rearranged with respect to their positions in the ancestral genome. We explored the phylogenetic relationships among the available oribatid mites, and the results confirmed the systematic position of Hermannia in the Crotonioidea superfamily. This was also supported by the synapomorphic gene-derived boundaries. Conclusions The tRNA “lost” phenomenon is not universal in oribatid mites. Rather, highly atypical secondary structure of the inferred mt tRNA genes made them unidentifiable using a single type of tRNA search program. The use of multi-software combined with a manual annotation approach can improve the accuracy of tRNA gene annotation. In addition, we identified the precise systematic position of Hermannia and validated that Astigmata is nested in Oribatida.

"['Background Previously, twelve Rickettsia species were identified in ticks, fleas, sheep keds ( Melophagus ovinus ), bats ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) and a tick-bitten patient in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwestern China. Here we aimed to molecularly detect rickettsial agents in red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ), marbled polecat ( Vormela peregusna ) and their ticks. Methods During 2018–2019, 12 red foxes, one marbled polecat and their ticks were sampled in two counties and a city of the XUAR. The heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of these 13 carnivores were dissected, followed by DNA extraction. Hard ticks were identified both morphologically and molecularly. All samples were examined for the presence of rickettsiae by amplifying four genetic markers ( 17-kDa, gltA, ompA, sca1 ). Results A total of 26 adult ticks and 28 nymphs (38 Ixodes canisuga , nine Ixodes kaiseri , six Haemaphysalis erinacei and one Dermacentor marginatus ) were collected from red foxes, and four Ha. erinacei ticks were removed from the marbled polecat. Analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) gene sequences indicated that 2–32 nucleotides differed between I. canisuga , I. kaiseri and Ha. erinacei from northwestern China and Europe. Rickettsia raoultii was detected in three red foxes, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in a red fox, Rickettsia sibirica in a red fox and a marbled polecat, and R. raoultii in two tick species ( I. canisuga and D . marginatus ). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, I. canisuga and I. kaiseri have not been previously reported from red foxes in China. The DNA of R. sibirica and R. raoultii was detected for the first time in the organs of red foxes, and R. sibirica in the organs of a marbled polecat.

"['Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus with high fatality and an expanding endemic. Currently, effective anti-SFTSV intervention remains unavailable. Favipiravir (T-705) was recently reported to show in vitro and in animal model antiviral efficacy against SFTSV. Here, we conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website, number ChiCTR1900023350). From May to August 2018, laboratory-confirmed SFTS patients were recruited from a designated hospital and randomly assigned to receive oral T-705 in combination with supportive care or supportive care only. Fatal outcome occurred in 9.5% (7/74) of T-705 treated patients and 18.3% (13/71) of controls (odds ratio, 0.466, 95% CI, 0.174–1.247). Cox regression showed a significant reduction in case fatality rate (CFR) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.366 (95% CI, 0.142–0.944). Among the low-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold ≥26), T-705 treatment significantly reduced CFR from 11.5 to 1.6% ( P \u2009=\u20090.029), while no between-arm difference was observed in the high-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold <26). The T-705-treated group showed shorter viral clearance, lower incidence of hemorrhagic signs, and faster recovery of laboratory abnormities compared with the controls. The in vitro and animal experiments demonstrated that the antiviral efficacies of T-705 were proportionally induced by SFTSV mutation rates, particularly from two transition mutation types. The mutation analyses on T-705-treated serum samples disclosed a partially consistent mutagenesis pattern as those of the in vitro or animal experiments in reducing the SFTSV viral loads, further supporting the anti-SFTSV effect of T-705, especially for the low-viral loads.']","['Li, Hao, [Jiang, Xia-Ming], [Cui, Ning], [Yuan, Chun], [Zhang, Shao-Fei], [Lu, Qing-Bin], [Yang, Zhen-Dong], [Xin, Qin-Lin], [Song, Ya-Bin], [Zhang, Xiao-Ai], [Liu, Hai-Zhou], [Du, Juan], [Fan, Xue-Juan], [Yuan, Lan], [Yuan, Yi-Mei], [Wang, Zhen], [Wang, Juan], [Zhang, Lan], [Zhang, Dong-Na], [Wang, Zhi-Bo], [Dai, Ke], [Bai, Jie-Ying], [Hao, Zhao-Nian], [Fan, Hang], [Fang, Li-Qun], [Xiao, Gengfu], [Yang, Yang], [Peng, Ke], [Wang, Hong-Quan], [Li, Jian-Xiong], [Zhang, Lei-Ke], [Liu, Wei]']",['10.1038/s41392-021-00541-3'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00541-3'],[''],['Clinical effect and antiviral mechanism of T-705 in treating severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome']

Proper treatment studies using compounds with microfilaricidal activity have not been performed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of a commercially available spot-on formulation containing moxidectin 2.5%/imidacloprid 10% for the treatment of O. lupi or Cercopithifilaria spp. skin-dwelling mfs in naturally infected dogs. Methods Privately owned dogs ( n \u2009=\u2009393) from southern Portugal were sampled via skin biopsies to identify and count mfs in 20\xa0µl of skin sediment. A total of 22 mfs-positive dogs were allocated to treatment group ( n \u2009=\u200911; G1) or left untreated as a control ( n \u2009=\u200911; G2). As a pilot investigation to test the treatment efficacy, five dogs assigned to G1 were treated four times at monthly intervals with moxidectin 2.5%/imidacloprid 10% spot-on formulation on SDs 0, 28 (±\u20092), 56 (±\u20092), and 84 (±\u20092). Based on the negative results for both O. lupi and/or Cercopithifilaria spp. mfs of dogs in the pilot study from SD28 onwards, the remaining six dogs in G1 were treated at SD0 and assessed only at SD28. Results Of the 393 animals sampled, 78 (19.8%) scored positive for skin-dwelling mfs. At the pilot investigation, a mean number of 19.6 mfs for O. lupi was recorded among five infected dogs whereas no mfs were detected at SD28. At SD0, the mean number of Cercopithifilaria spp. larvae was 12.6 for G1 and 8.7 for G2. The mean number of mfs for G2 was 20.09. Conclusions Results herein obtained suggest that a single treatment with moxidectin 2.5%/imidacloprid 10% spot-on formulation is efficacious against skin-dwelling mfs in dogs.

"['Background Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a serious threat to humans, wildlife and livestock, and cause severe economic losses in many tropical drylands. The effective control of TBDs has been constrained by limited understanding of what determines tick loads in animals. We tested interactive effects of several biological factors (sex, age and body condition), one environmental factor (rainfall) and one human factor (management type) on tick loads in animals. Methods We collected ticks on animals at four sampling sites in the semi-arid savanna area of Laikipia County, Kenya, of which two are commercial ranches and the other two are open pastoral grazing areas. From 2017 to 2019, we collected a total of 2038 ticks from 619 domestic animals from various cattle and camel herds and from 79 tranquilised wild animals. Results Generally, wild herbivores (zebras, rhinos and elephants) had higher tick loads than domestic animals. As 83% of the tick samples were taken from Boran cattle, we analysed tick load in these cattle in more detail. Boran cattle had high tick loads in the wet season, especially those animals in poor condition. No differences were found between female and male cattle, regardless of season. The calves had high tick loads during both the wet and dry seasons, whereas the sub-adult and adult cattle had less ticks during the dry season. Cattle on the intensively managed ranches had lower tick load than those in the transhumant management system. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of establishing effective control of ticks on domestic animals in transhumant management systems as tick loads were high on these animals in both the wet and dry season.

"['Introduction We have earlier shown that hyperoxia (HO)-induced sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling contribute to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). S1P acts through G protein-coupled receptors, S1P 1 through S1P 5 . Further, we noted that heterozygous deletion of S1pr1 ameliorated the HO-induced BPD in the murine model. The mechanism by which S1P 1 signaling contributes to HO-induced BPD was explored. Methods S1pr1 +/+ and S1pr1 +/− mice pups were exposed to either room air (RA) or HO (75% oxygen) for 7 days from PN 1–7. Lung injury and alveolar simplification was evaluated. Lung protein expression was determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In vitro experiments were performed using human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) with S1P 1 inhibitor, NIBR0213 to interrogate the S1P 1 signaling pathway. Results HO increased the expression of S1pr1 gene as well as S1P 1 protein in both neonatal lungs and HLMVECs. The S1pr1 +/− neonatal mice showed significant protection against HO-induced BPD which was accompanied by reduced inflammation markers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. HO-induced reduction in ANG-1, TIE-2, and VEGF was rescued in S1pr1 +/ − mouse, accompanied by an improvement in the number of arterioles in the lung. HLMVECs exposed to HO increased the expression of KLF-2 accompanied by reduced expression of TIE-2, which was reversed with S1P 1 inhibition. Conclusion HO induces S1P 1 followed by reduced expression of angiogenic factors. Reduction of S1P 1 signaling restores ANG-1/ TIE-2 signaling leading to improved angiogenesis and alveolarization thus protecting against HO-induced neonatal lung injury.']","['Sudhadevi, Tara, [Jafri, Anjum], [Ha, Alison W.], [Basa, Prathima], [Thomas, Jaya M.], [Fu, Panfeng], [Wary, Kishore], [Mehta, Dolly], [Natarajan, Viswanathan], [Harijith, Anantha]']",['10.1007/s12013-021-01014-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12013-021-01014-8'],[''],['Hyperoxia-induced S1P1 signaling reduced angiogenesis by suppression of TIE-2 leading to experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia']
"['Background Cylindrospermopsin is a highly persistent cyanobacterial secondary metabolite toxic to humans and other living organisms. Strain OF001 and A210 are manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) able to transform cylindrospermopsin during the oxidation of Mn 2+ . So far, the enzymes involved in manganese oxidation in strain OF001 and A210 are unknown. Therefore, we analyze the genomes of two cylindrospermopsin-transforming MOB, Pseudomonas sp. OF001 and Rubrivivax sp. A210, to identify enzymes that could catalyze the oxidation of Mn 2+ . We also investigated specific metabolic features related to pollutant degradation and explored the metabolic potential of these two MOB with respect to the role they may play in biotechnological applications and/or in the environment. Results Strain OF001 encodes two multicopper oxidases and one haem peroxidase potentially involved in Mn 2+ oxidation, with a high similarity to manganese-oxidizing enzymes described for Pseudomonas putida GB-1 (80, 83 and 42% respectively). Strain A210 encodes one multicopper oxidase potentially involved in Mn 2+ oxidation, with a high similarity (59%) to the manganese-oxidizing multicopper oxidase in Leptothrix discophora SS-1. Strain OF001 and A210 have genes that might confer them the ability to remove aromatic compounds via the catechol meta- and ortho-cleavage pathway, respectively. Based on the genomic content, both strains may grow over a wide range of O 2 concentrations, including microaerophilic conditions, fix nitrogen, and reduce nitrate and sulfate in an assimilatory fashion. Moreover, the strain A210 encodes genes which may convey the ability to reduce nitrate in a dissimilatory manner, and fix carbon via the Calvin cycle. Both MOB encode CRISPR-Cas systems, several predicted genomic islands, and phage proteins, which likely contribute to their genome plasticity. Conclusions The genomes of Pseudomonas sp. OF001 and Rubrivivax sp. A210 encode sequences with high similarity to already described MCOs which may catalyze manganese oxidation required for cylindrospermopsin transformation. Furthermore, the analysis of the general metabolism of two MOB strains may contribute to a better understanding of the niches of cylindrospermopsin-removing MOB in natural habitats and their implementation in biotechnological applications to treat water.']","['Martínez-Ruiz, Erika Berenice, [Cooper, Myriel], [Barrero-Canosa, Jimena], [Haryono, Mindia A.

"['Background The COVID-19 pandemic is putting significant pressure on the hospital system. To help clinicians in the rapid triage of patients at high risk of COVID-19 while waiting for RT-PCR results, different diagnostic prediction models have been developed. Our objective is to identify, compare, and evaluate performances of prediction models for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adult patients in a health care setting. Methods A search for relevant references has been conducted on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Rigorous eligibility criteria have been established (e.g., adult participants, suspicion of COVID-19, medical setting) and applied by two independent investigators to identify suitable studies at 2 different stages: (1) titles and abstracts screening and (2) full-texts screening. Risk of bias (RoB) has been assessed using the Prediction model study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Data synthesis has been presented according to a narrative report of findings. Results Out of the 2334 references identified by the literature search, 13 articles have been included in our systematic review. The studies, carried out all over the world, were performed in 2020. The included articles proposed a model developed using different methods, namely, logistic regression, score, machine learning, XGBoost. All the included models performed well to discriminate adults at high risks of presenting COVID-19 (all area under the ROC curve (AUROC)\u2009>\u20090.500).

"['Background Studies in developed countries have reported that the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and this phenomenon is associated with urbanization and changing indoor microbiome exposure. Developing countries such as China have experienced rapid urbanization in past years, but no study has investigated microbiome exposure and urban-rural health effects in these countries. Methods Nine high schools from urban and rural areas were randomly selected in Shanxi Province, China, and classroom vacuum dust was collected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A self-administered questionnaire was collected from 1332 students for personal information and health data. Three-level logistic regression was performed between microbial richness/abundance/functional pathways and the occurrence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms. Results Consistent with developed countries, the prevalence of wheeze and rhinitis was higher in urban areas than in rural areas (p < 0.05). Metagenomic profiling revealed 8302 bacterial, 395 archaeal, 744 fungal, 524 protist and 1103 viral species in classroom dust. Actinobacteria (mean relative abundance 49.7%), Gammaproteobacteria (18.4%) and Alphaproteobacteria (10.0%) were the most abundant bacterial classes. The overall microbiome composition was significantly different between urban and rural schools (p = 0.001, Adonis). Species from Betaproteobactera, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli were enriched in urban schools, and species from Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were enriched in rural schools. Potential pathogens were present in higher abundance in urban schools than in rural schools (p < 0.05).

"['Glioma is the most common primary tumor in the central nervous system. However, the development of glioma and effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive. Here, we identify GPR17 as a potential target to treat glioma. Data mining with human LGG and GBM samples reveals that GPR17 is negatively correlated with glioma development. Overexpressing GPR17 inhibits glioma cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by raising ROS levels. GPR17-overexpressing glioma cells are less tumorigenic in the brain than in control cells. Mechanistically, GPR17 inhibits the transcription of RNF2 , a key component in the PRC1 complex, through cAMP/PKA/NF-κB signaling, leading to reduced histone H2A monoubiquitination. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analyses reveal KLF9 as a direct target of RNF2. KLF9 mediates the functions of GPR17 and RNF2 in glioma cells. Furthermore, activation of GPR17 by its agonist inhibits glioma formation. Our findings have thus identified GPR17 as a key regulator of glioma development and a potential therapeutic target for gliomas.']","['Liu, Huiqing, [Xing, Rui], [Ou, Zhimin], [Zhao, Junying], [Hong, Guolin], [Zhao, Tong-Jin], [Han, Ying], [Chen, Ying]']",['10.1038/s41419-021-03897-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03897-0'],[''],['G-protein-coupled receptor GPR17 inhibits glioma development by increasing polycomb repressive complex 1-mediated ROS production']
"['Sugarcane cultivation in India dates back to 5000 BC, but its genetic improvement through breeding commenced only in the nineteenth century. A major breakthrough in yield improvement happened in 1918 with the release of the first interspecific hybrid cultivar Co 205. This cultivar replaced all earlier varieties and made interspecific hybrids the basis of future sugarcane improvement. The tri-specific hybrids {( S. officinarum × S. spontaneum ) × S. barberi } developed at Indian Council of Agriculture Research-Sugarcane Breeding Institute (ICAR-SBI) as Coimbatore canes (Co canes) were popular in India and in several other countries as varieties or parents. Improved sugarcane varieties have made a major contribution in increasing yield from 30.9 t/ha in 1930 to 79.6 t/ha during 2018–2019 and sugar recovery from 8.96% to 11.01% in the same period. A national network of sugarcane varietal improvement programme involving 24 sugarcane centres covering the entire country now operates. This program is based on seedlings derived from an annual crossing program at the National Hybridization Garden at ICAR-SBI, Coimbatore. Varietal testing is conducted by 36 centres and has identified 124 varieties through All India Coordinated Research Programme (Sugarcane) for five agroclimatic zones in the country since 1982. During 2000 to 2019, 67 varieties were released for commercial cultivation. Among the present varieties, Co 0238, cultivated on 2.77 Mha, and Co 86032, on 0.89 Mha are the two predominant varieties in India. The pace of varietal improvement has remained high through studies on breeding and selection methodologies, expanding the genetic base and genetic diversity of parental pools for nuclear and cytoplasmic genes and targeted genetic improvement of important traits. This has improved precision and efficiency of breeding. Micropropagation has been a success for rapid multiplication and accelerated adoption of new varieties. Genetic improvement of sugarcane through conventional breeding is increasingly complemented by molecular research to improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, specifically for red rot and drought, and biomass, to make sugarcane a major source of both a sugar and renewable energy.']","['Ram, Bakshi, [Hemaprabha, G.], [Singh, B.

Unlike the extent of research in preterm neonates, risk factors associated with incidence and severity of NRDS in term neonates are not well studied. In this study, we examined the association of maternal and neonatal risk factors with the incidence and severity of NRDS in term neonates admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in Cyprus. Methods In a prospective, case-control design we recruited term neonates with NRDS and non-NRDS admitted to the NICU of Archbishop Makarios III hospital, the only neonatal tertiary centre in Cyprus, between April 2017–October 2018. Clinical data were obtained from patients’ files. We used univariate and multivariate logistic and linear regression models to analyse binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Results During the 18-month study period, 134 term neonates admitted to NICU were recruited, 55 (41%) with NRDS diagnosis and 79 with non-NRDS as controls. In multivariate adjusted analysis, male gender ( OR : 4.35, 95% CI: 1.03–18.39, p \u2009=\u20090.045) and elective caesarean section ( OR : 11.92, 95% CI: 1.80–78.95, p \u2009=\u20090.01) were identified as independent predictors of NRDS. Among neonates with NRDS, early-onset infection tended to be associated with increased administration of surfactant ( β :0.75, 95% CI: −\u20090.02-1.52, p \u2009=\u20090.055). Incidence of pulmonary hypertension or systemic hypotension were associated with longer duration of parenteral nutrition (pulmonary hypertension: 11Vs 5\u2009days, p \u2009<\u20090.001, systemic hypotension: 7 Vs 4\u2009days, p \u2009=\u20090.01) and higher rate of blood transfusion (pulmonary hypertension: 100% Vs 67%, p \u2009=\u20090.045, systemic hypotension: 85% Vs 55%, p \u2009=\u20090.013).

Here we prepare a recombinant version of human Mediator, reconstitute a 50-subunit Mediator–PIC complex and determine the structure of the complex by cryo-electron microscopy. The head module of Mediator contacts the stalk of Pol\xa0II and the general transcription factors TFIIB and TFIIE, resembling the Mediator–PIC interactions observed in the corresponding complex in yeast 7 – 9 . The metazoan subunits MED27–MED30 associate with exposed regions in MED14 and MED17 to form the proximal part of the Mediator tail module that binds activators. Mediator positions the flexibly linked cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase of the general transcription factor TFIIH near the linker to the C-terminal repeat domain of Pol\xa0II. The Mediator shoulder domain holds the CDK-activating kinase subunit CDK7, whereas the hook domain contacts a CDK7 element that flanks the kinase active site. The shoulder and hook domains reside in the Mediator head and middle modules, respectively, which can move relative to each other and may induce an active conformation of the CDK7 kinase to allosterically stimulate phosphorylation\xa0of the C-terminal domain.

"['An ambitious vanilla ( Vanilla planifolia Jacks. ex Andrews) breeding program was started in Madagascar in the early 1950s to control Fusariosis, a serious crop disease caused by the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum . The breeding program has produced tens of thousands of new vanilla genotypes of which a small number have been selected and conserved. This article examines the history of the Malagasy breeding work during the second half of the twentieth century, and outlines a possible strategy to exploit the data and exceptional genetic resources it has produced. The National Center for Research Applied to Rural Development has preserved 19 of the very diverse and original hybrids at the vanilla station in Ambohitsara (Antalaha, Madagascar). Two of them are particularly remarkable, namely Manitra ampotony for its exceptionally high vanillin content and Tsy taitra for its strong resistance to Fusariosis and its aromatic profile, which is similar to that of Bourbon vanilla. However, the global vanilla industry remains fragile because varietal diversity now available cannot overcome current and foreseeable constraints. The hybrids formed from multiple crosses between V. planifolia and three aromatic species, ( V. pompona Schiede, V. tahitensis J.W. Moore and V. phaeantha Rchb.f.), constitute a preferred resource for further vanilla breeding.

Among the key determinants of chromatin organization are the histone modifications that correlate with a given transcriptional status and chromatin state. Until recently, the details for the segregation of nucleosomes on DNA replication and their implications in re-establishing heritable chromatin domains remained unclear. Here, we review recent findings detailing the local segregation of parental nucleosomes and highlight important advances as to how histone methyltransferases associated with the establishment of repressive chromatin domains facilitate epigenetic inheritance. Maintenance of cell-type identity requires the faithful inheritance of chromatin states through cell division, despite the challenges posed by the disruptive passage of the DNA replication fork and the dilution of nucleosome components in complex with the daughter DNA strands.

"['In recent years, immunotherapy has proven to be an effective treatment against cancer. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes perform an important role in this anti-tumor immune response, recognizing cancer cells as foreign, through the presentation of tumor antigens by MHC class I molecules. However, tumors and metastases develop escape mechanisms for evading this immunosurveillance and may lose the expression of these polymorphic molecules to become invisible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In other situations, they may maintain MHC class I expression and promote immunosuppression of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, the analysis of the expression of MHC class I molecules in tumors and metastases is important to elucidate these escape mechanisms. Moreover, it is necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in these alterations to reverse them and recover the expression of MHC class I molecules on tumor cells. This review discusses the role and regulation of MHC class I expression in tumor progression.

Although genetic improvement of sugarcane dates back to 1891, sugarcane breeding work on a substantial scale began in Mauritius in 1930 with the creation of the Sugarcane Research Station. In 1953, the Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute (MSIRI) was created and was responsible for all research pertaining to the Mauritian sugar industry, with sugarcane breeding being one of its most important research thrusts. Currently, the MSIRI has a germplasm collection of 2500 accessions. Its breeding programme constitutes a hybridization phase where annually some 250–500 different family combinations are made in controlled glasshouses and 50,000–100,000 seedlings are produced. The selection programme spans over 15\xa0years and comprises six selection stages. Genetic studies back the programme in order to improve breeding and selection efficiencies to generate resilient varieties with higher productivity and least cost of production. The MSIRI has released 76 varieties to date, and the most recent ones, showing high productivity, low flowering behaviour and adapted to the various climatic conditions, are expected to contribute significantly to the sustainability of the industry.

This study aimed to develop therapeutic tumour vaccines based on double-activation of CD8 + T and NK cells. Methods The immune Epitope database, Molecular Operating Environment software, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for epitope identification. Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, UPLC-QTOF-MS, and RNA-seq were utilized for evaluating immunity of PBMC-derived DCs, CD8 + T or NK cells and related pathways. HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice combined with immunologically reconstituted tumour-bearing mice were used to examine the antitumour effect and safety of epitope vaccines. Results We identified novel HLA-A2.1-restricted extracellular matrix protein 1(ECM1)-derived immunodominant epitopes in which LA induced a potent immune response. We also found that LA-loaded DCs upregulated the frequency of CD3 + /CD8 + T cells, CD45RO + /CD69 + activated memory T cells, and CD3 − /CD16 + /CD56 + NK cells. We demonstrated cytotoxic granule release of LA/DC-CTLs or LA/DC-NK cells and cytotoxicity against tumour cells and microtissue blocks via the predominant IFN-γ/perforin/granzyme B cell death pathway. Further investigating the mechanism of LA-mediated CD8 + T activation, we found that LA could be internalized into DCs through phagocytosis and then formed a LA-MHC-I complex presented onto the DC surface for recognition of the T cell receptor to upregulate Zap70 phosphorylation levels to further activate CD8 + T cells by DC-CTL interactions. In addition, LA-mediated DC-NK crosstalk through stimulation of the TLR4-p38 MAPK pathway increased MICA/B expression on DCs to interact with NKG2D for NK activation. Promisingly, LA could activate CD8 + T cells and NK cells simultaneously via interacting with DCs to suppress tumours in vivo. Moreover, the safety of LA was confirmed.

Randomly oriented non-woven nanofibers were fabricated using the electrospinning process. The process conditions were optimized at 15\xa0kV applied voltage, 8\xa0cm distance between the spinneret needle and the collector plate, and 1.6\xa0ml/h feed flow rate for the best nanofiber characteristics and high filtration efficiency.

Results confirmed that the porosity of the membrane had a significant effect on the flow rate of permeate. The biochemical characteristics of neera filtrate were investigated. In comparison with fresh neera , the filtered counterpart had significant changes in titratable acidity, pH, and color. While no significant changes were observed in total soluble solids content, slight reductions were noted in the total polyphenolic content and minerals. Importantly, the neera filtrate obtained through the optimized nanofibrous membrane showed a 2 log-reduction in yeast load.

Tight control of PERK-eIF2α signaling has been shown to be necessary for normal long-lasting synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, including memory. In contrast, chronic activation of PERK-eIF2α signaling has been shown to contribute to pathophysiology, including memory impairments, associated with multiple neurological diseases, making this pathway an attractive therapeutic target.

Conditional expression of phospho-mutant eIF2α in DA neurons recapitulated the phenotypes caused by deletion of PERK, consistent with a causal role of decreased eIF2α phosphorylation for these phenotypes. In addition, deletion of PERK in DA neurons resulted in altered de novo translation, as well as changes in axonal DA release and uptake in the striatum that mirror the pattern of motor changes observed.

"['Strategies targeting nucleolin have enabled a significant improvement in intracellular bioavailability of their encapsulated payloads. In this respect, assessment of the impact of target cell heterogeneity and nucleolin homology across species (structurally and functionally) is of major importance. This work also aimed at mathematically modelling the nucleolin expression levels at the cell membrane, binding and internalization of pH-sensitive pegylated liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin and functionalized with the nucleolin-binding F3 peptide (PEGASEMP), and resulting cytotoxicity against cancer cells from mouse, rat, canine, and human origin. Herein, it was shown that nucleolin expression levels were not a limitation on the continuous internalization of F3 peptide-targeted liposomes, despite the saturable nature of the binding mechanism. Modeling enabled the prediction of nucleolin-mediated total doxorubicin exposure provided by the experimental settings of the assessment of PEGASEMP’s impact on cell death. The former increased proportionally with nucleolin-binding sites, a measure relevant for patient stratification. This pattern of variation was observed for the resulting cell death in nonsaturating conditions, depending on the cancer cell sensitivity to doxorubicin. This approach differs from standard determination of cytotoxic concentrations, which normally report values of incubation doses rather than the actual intracellular bioactive drug exposure. Importantly, in the context of development of nucleolin-based targeted drug delivery, the structural nucleolin homology (higher than 84%) and functional similarity across species presented herein, emphasized the potential to use toxicological data and other metrics from lower species to infer the dose for a first-in-human trial.

We survey the history and mechanism of coronaviruses, and the structural characteristics of the spike protein and its key residues responsible for human transmissions. Methods We have carried out a systematic review to summarize the origin, transmission and etiology of COVID-19. The structural analysis of the spike protein and its disordered residues explains the mechanism of the viral transmission. A meta-data analysis of the therapeutic compounds targeting the SARS-CoV-2 is also included. Results Coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and infect humans with unexpected consequences for public health. The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher compared to that of the closely related SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, intrinsically disordered regions are observed at the interface of the spike protein and ACE2 receptor, providing a shape complementarity to the complex. The key residues of the spike protein have stronger binding affinity with ACE2. These can be probable reasons for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2.

"['The accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis—which is critical for genome stability across sexual cycles—relies on homologous recombination initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by the Spo11 protein 1 , 2 . The formation of DSBs is regulated and tied to the elaboration of large-scale chromosome structures 3 – 5 , but the protein assemblies that execute and control DNA breakage are poorly understood. Here we address this through the molecular characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RMM (Rec114, Mei4 and Mer2) proteins—essential, conserved components of the DSB machinery 2 . Each subcomplex of Rec114–Mei4 (a 2:1 heterotrimer) or Mer2 (a coiled-coil-containing homotetramer) is monodispersed in solution, but they independently condense with DNA into reversible nucleoprotein clusters that share properties with phase-separated systems. Multivalent interactions drive this condensation. Mutations that weaken protein–DNA interactions strongly disrupt both condensate formation and DSBs in vivo, and thus these processes are highly correlated. In vitro, condensates fuse into mixed RMM clusters that further recruit Spo11 complexes. Our data show how the DSB machinery self-assembles on chromosome axes to create centres of DSB activity. We propose that multilayered control of Spo11 arises from the recruitment of regulatory components and modulation of the biophysical properties of the condensates. During meiosis, Mer2 and the Rec114–Mei4 complex form condensates that facilitate the formation of double-strand DNA breaks by recruiting the Spo11 transesterase complex.']","['Claeys Bouuaert, Corentin, [Pu, Stephen], [Wang, Juncheng], [Oger, Cédric], [Daccache, Dima], [Xie, Wei], [Patel, Dinshaw J.], [Keeney, Scott]']",['10.1038/s41586-021-03374-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03374-w'],[''],['DNA-driven condensation assembles the meiotic DNA break machinery']

A series of remote interviews across Africa and direct field observations were respectively conducted at the Takoradi port to develop an understanding of the MWS service product, to ascertain the conditions resulting from current challenges, and to determine contingencies and innovations to ensure full service. The study finds MWS service as paramount to the energy industry with its range of risk control checks for high-value assets and operations. Surveyors demonstrated high-levels of awareness for Covid-19 crises and regulatory policies while in adherence but noted challenges of high-cost and delays as by-products of the restrictions. Surveyors deemed site attendances as crucial in their practice at all time, though recognized the several social and technologically innovative approaches adopted industry-wide to facing the pandemic. The study highlights the need for ‘essential worker’ status and the introduction of innovative insurance packages.']","['Sackey, Anthony Djaba, [Tchouangeup, Bertrand], [Lamptey, Benjamin Lantei], [Merwe, Bosman], [Lee, Rapheal Ofosu-Dua], [Mensah, Robert], [Fuseini, Musah Chantiwuni], [Sackey, Abigail Dede]']",['10.1007/s40152-021-00220-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40152-021-00220-7'],[''],['Outlining the challenges of Covid-19 health crises in Africa’s maritime industry: the case of maritime operations in marine warranty surveying practice']
"['Prognosis of severe heart failure remains poor. Urgent new therapies are required. Some heart failure patients do not respond to established multidisciplinary treatment and are classified as “non-responders”. The outcome is especially poor for non-responders, and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), a mitochondrial fusion protein, is significantly reduced in non-responding patients. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Mfn1 in the failing heart. Twenty-two idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy of intraventricular septum were included. Of the 22 patients, 8 were non-responders (left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) of\u2009<\u200910% improvement at late phase follow-up). Electron microscopy (EM), quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence studies were performed to explore the biological processes and molecules involved in failure to respond. Studies in cardiac specific Mfn1 knockout mice (c-Mfn1 KO), and in vitro studies with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were also conducted. A significant reduction in mitochondrial size in cardiomyocytes, and Mfn1, was observed in non-responders. A LV pressure overload with thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) c-Mfn1 KO mouse model was generated. Systolic function was reduced in c-Mfn1 KO mice, while mitochondria alteration in TAC c-Mfn1 KO mice increased. In vitro studies in NRVMs indicated negative regulation of Mfn1 by the β-AR/cAMP/PKA/miR-140-5p pathway resulting in significant reduction in mitochondrial respiration of NRVMs. The level of miR140-5p was increased in cardiac tissues of non-responders. Mfn1 is a biomarker of heart failure in non-responders.

"['In this work, we develop a general model of a mass sensor made of N weakly mechanically coupled microbeams subject to electric actuation. The developed model is verified by comparing the simulated pull-in voltages, natural frequencies, and frequency response of a two-weakly coupled beam system against their experimental counterparts reported in the literature. The sensitivity of the mass sensor in terms of frequency shift is observed to significantly increase when enlarging the size of the beams array. The simulation results reveal a clear transformation of the frequency response from a nearly linear to nonlinear behavior as result of the deposition of a small mass on the coupled system. As such, we show the potential use of bifurcations that result in an abrupt jump to a large-amplitude motion for sensing purposes. Furthermore, by exploiting the mode localization effect, the nonlinear response can be triggered on one of the beams when an added masses is introduced, allowing for an amplitude-based mass detection mechanism of the device. The proposed sensing method has the possibility to operate in bifurcation mode for mass threshold detection that can be tuned using the AC actuation or in continuous mode based on extracting the added mass from the amplitude of the sensing beam’s oscillations.']","['Alkaddour, Muhannad, [Ghommem, Mehdi], [Najar, Fehmi]']",['10.1007/s11071-021-06298-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06298-2'],[''],['Nonlinear analysis and effectiveness of weakly coupled microbeams for mass sensing applications']
"['Rapid cellular responses to environmental stimuli are fundamental for development and maturation. Immediate early genes can be transcriptionally induced within minutes in response to a variety of signals. How their induction levels are regulated and their untimely activation by spurious signals prevented during development is poorly understood. We found that in developing sensory neurons, before perinatal sensory-activity-dependent induction, immediate early genes are embedded into a unique bipartite Polycomb chromatin signature, carrying active H3K27ac on promoters but repressive Ezh2-dependent H3K27me3 on gene bodies. This bipartite signature is widely present in developing cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Polycomb marking of gene bodies inhibits mRNA elongation, dampening productive transcription, while still allowing for fast stimulus-dependent mark removal and bipartite gene induction. We reveal a developmental epigenetic mechanism regulating the rapidity and amplitude of the transcriptional response to relevant stimuli, while preventing inappropriate activation of stimulus-response genes.

An understanding of developmental processes in this group is expected to provide important insights into the evolutionary events necessary for the emergence of complex multicellularity. Here, we focus on mechanisms of epigenetic regulation involving post-translational modifications of histone proteins. Results A total of 47 histone post-translational modifications are identified, including a novel mark H2AZR38me1, but Ectocarpus lacks both H3K27me3 and the major polycomb complexes. ChIP-seq identifies modifications associated with transcription start sites and gene bodies of active genes and with transposons. H3K79me2 exhibits an unusual pattern, often marking large genomic regions spanning several genes. Transcription start sites of closely spaced, divergently transcribed gene pairs share a common nucleosome-depleted region and exhibit shared histone modification peaks. Overall, patterns of histone modifications are stable through the life cycle. Analysis of histone modifications at generation-biased genes identifies a correlation between the presence of specific chromatin marks and the level of gene expression. Conclusions The overview of histone post-translational modifications in the brown alga presented here will provide a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the role of chromatin modifications in the regulation of brown algal genomes.']","['Bourdareau, Simon, [Tirichine, Leila], [Lombard, Bérangère], [Loew, Damarys], [Scornet, Delphine], [Wu, Yue], [Coelho, Susana M.], [Cock, J.

Now that the coronavirus causes a disease that makes us realize that life is not as malleable in everything as we wish, they would have been almost prophetic if he had added the word “viruses” after “the most terrible parasites.” Long before Maarten ‘t Hart, ancient philosophers refused to accept the idea that creation is only cruel and chaotic. In this chapter, we will discuss how every crisis is an opportunity to continue to grow, either personally or collectively, or to come to a deeper understanding.

"['In recent years, natural phytochemicals are gaining much attention for their antimicrobial potential. Garlic and turmeric are most widely used from the natural source, and their constituents directly or indirectly provide various health benefits, especially due to antimicrobial potential. Though the conventional antimicrobial compounds are effective against various pathogens, up till now there is a necessity of effective agents against MDR pathogens. Phytochemicals have been used for their antimicrobial potential from ancient times. These phytochemicals can work by multiple mechanisms, such as by inhibiting target modifying and drug degrading enzymes or as efflux pump inhibitors. The use of natural phytoconstituents (e.g., curcumin from turmeric and allicin from garlic) from these two medicinal plants may be an alternative strategy and can overcome the side effects associated with antibiotics or other allopathic means of treatment. A wide range of indications has revealed the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds on bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. To improve safety and efficacy, these phytoconstituents have been delivered using nanoformulations such as liposomes, hydrogels, and nanoparticles for the treatment against different bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites infections.

These compounds possess not only high antioxidant activity but also many other bioactive properties, with anticancer activity as well. Very important sources of phenolic compounds in the human diet are coffee brew and tea leaves infusion. In this chapter, modern high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry\xa0(LC-MS) methods are described for the determination of chlorogenic acids (CGAs) in coffees as well as catechins and theaflavins (TFs) in white, green, yellow, oolong, black, and pu-erh teas. Nowadays, the consumption of hot beverages is still common, and some other special coffees have become more and more popular. Apart from the roasting process, other special treatment processes of coffee beans such as steaming, decaffeination, or natural fermentation (Kopi Luwak coffee) influence the composition of chlorogenic acids and/or other phenolic compounds of coffee brew. Instant coffees and “ready-to-drink” coffee beverages are available on the market as well. In addition, coffee brews prepared by different methods contain a wide and dissimilar level of total chlorogenic acids and their lactones. Coffee leaves infusions, drunk from ages, also possess phenolic compounds and bioactive properties. Moreover, the preparation of tea leaves and/or buds (non-oxidized, semi-oxidized, fully oxidized, and post-fermented) influences the catechins, theaflavins, and other bioactive compounds present in tea infusions. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of tea can be improved by the addition of spices (e.g., cayenne pepper), flowers (e.g., jasmine), herbs (mint or basil), fruits (e.g., lemon or dried fruits), bergamot oil, and also chocolate. The most common flavored black tea types are Earl Grey and masala.

Randomised trials initially with nivolumab and later with pembrolizumab established overall survival benefit in patients with R/M HNSCC previously treated with platinum compared to physicians choice of 2nd line therapy, and have led to regulatory approval around the world. More recently the Keynote-048 trial has compared both pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab + platinum/5FU to the Extreme regimen of platinum/5FU/cetuximab in the first-line R/M setting. The key findings from this trial are that pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to Extreme improved overall survival in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS)\xa0≥\xa020 and ≥\xa01, and that pembro/chemotherapy improved OS in CPS\xa0≥\xa020, CPS\xa0≥\xa01 and the total population.

Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks.

Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

However, no supernovae have unequivocally been identified from an electron-capture origin, partly because of uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we present six indicators of electron-capture supernovae and show that supernova 2018zd is the only known supernova with strong evidence for or consistent with all six: progenitor identification, circumstellar material, chemical composition 5 – 7 , explosion energy, light curve and nucleosynthesis 8 – 12 . For supernova 2018zd, we infer a super-asymptotic giant branch progenitor based on the faint candidate in the pre-explosion images and the chemically enriched circumstellar material revealed by the early ultraviolet colours and flash spectroscopy. The light-curve morphology and nebular emission lines can be explained by the low explosion energy and neutron-rich nucleosynthesis produced in an electron-capture supernova. This identification provides insights into the complex stellar evolution, supernova physics, cosmic nucleosynthesis and remnant populations in the transitional mass range.

Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases. Extracellular vesicles have been implicated in the transmission of pathogens from the arthropod to the human host. Here the authors show that tick-derived extracellular vesicles play a role in feeding and modulate the outcome of bacterial infection.']","['Oliva Chávez, Adela S., [Wang, Xiaowei], [Marnin, Liron], [Archer, Nathan K.], [Hammond, Holly L.], [Carroll, Erin E.

"['Background The speed with which acaricides paralyze and kill ticks is relevant to impeding pathogen transmission. The objective of this study was to assess early-onset lotilaner effects on the motility and weights of Amblyomma americanum ticks collected from treated dogs. Methods Twelve healthy dogs were randomized between two groups to receive either lotilaner (Credelio ® ) on Day 0 or to be sham treated. On Day 7, 25 male and 25 female A. americanum were placed under bandages, two on each flank of each dog. After 30 or 45\xa0min, all unattached ticks were removed and T \u2009=\u20090 was set. At T \u2009=\u20092, 4, 8 and 24\xa0h post attachment, 5 attached ticks removed from each bandage on each dog were weighed, assessed by blinded observers for righting ability and movement recorded. Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean tick weights from the treated group were significantly lower at 24\xa0h than at earlier time points ( P male \u2009<\u20090.0307; P female \u2009=\u20090.0021). At 4 and 8\xa0h, significantly fewer ticks from treated (14.3%, 0.0%, respectively) than from control dogs could right (73.3%, 70.0%) ( P 4h \u2009<\u20090.0001; P 8h \u2009=\u20090.0024) (at 24\xa0h, all ticks from treated dogs were dead), and distance moved was significantly less at all time points ( P 2h \u2009=\u20090.0413; P 4h , P 8h \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean and maximum velocity of ticks from treated dogs were significantly lower, relative to controls, at 4 and 8\xa0h ( P \u2009≤\u20090.0001). Within the treated group, collected ticks had significantly lower mean and maximum velocities at 4 and 8\xa0h compared to 2\xa0h ( P mean \u2009<\u20090.0042; P max \u2009<\u20090.0194). Conclusion The observed changes indicate that lotilaner may disrupt tick attachment. In ticks that attached, a progressive impairment of neuromuscular processes began within 2\xa0h.

"['Purpose Coxiella burnetii is known for its potential as veterinary and human bacterial pathogen. The bacteria have been described in ticks, but their role in transmission of Q fever in humans is considered low. Coxiella endosymbionts closely related to C. burnetii have been also isolated from an extensive range of tick species and evidence is growing that these endosymbionts could be linked to human bacteremia. The aim of this study was to get new information on the presence of Coxiella species in ticks infesting wild and domestic hosts in Sardinia, Italy. Methods Here, 138 ticks collected from the study area were analyzed for the presence of C. burnetii and Coxiella- like bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and philogenetic analyses using a set of primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Results DNA of Coxiella species was detected in 69% of the total ticks examined. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA Coxiella genotypes identified in this study grouped in strongly supported monophyletic clades with identified reference sequences of CLEs detected from Rhipicephalus , Dermacentor , Haemaphysalis and Ornithodoros species and with Coxiella burnetii strains isolated worldwide. Conclusion This study reports the molecular detection of a high diversity of Coxiella- like bacteria in Sardinian ticks and confirms also the presence of C. burnetii in tick species previously identified in the island. The role that Coxiella -like endosymbionts play in Sardinian ticks and in their vertebrate hosts needs to be explored further.']","['Chisu, Valentina, [Mura, Lorena], [Foxi, Cipriano], [Masala, Giovanna]']",['10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-020-00324-w'],[''],"['Coxiellaceae in Ticks from Human, Domestic and Wild Hosts from Sardinia, Italy: High Diversity of Coxiella-like Endosymbionts']"

The aim of this study is to screen the important tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) carried by hard ticks in Inner Mongolia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and to estimate the risk of human infection imposed by tick bites. Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level. Individual tick DNA samples were detected by genus--specific or group-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these TBPs and combined with DNA sequencing assay to confirm the results of mNGS. Results R. raoultii (45.32%, 92/203), Candidatus R. tarasevichiae (5.42%, 11/203), Anaplasma sp.

However, the characteristics and functional divergence of the PUB gene family\xa0have not yet been previously studied in the Chinese white pear ( Pyrus bretschneideri ). Results In the present study, we identified 62 PbrPUBs in Chinese white pear genome. Based on the phylogenetic relationship, 62 PUB genes were clustered into five groups. The results of conserved motif and gene structure analysis supported the classification phylogenetic tree. The PbrPUB genes were unevenly distribution on 17 pear chromosomes, chromosome 15 housed most member of PUB family, with eight PUB genes. Cis -acting element analysis indicated that PUB genes might participate in diverse biological processes, especially in the response to abiotic stresses. Based on RNA-data from ‘Dangshansuli’ at seven tissues, we found that PUB genes exhibited diverse of expression level in seven tissues, and qRT-PCR experiment further supported the reliable of RNA-Seq data. To identify candidate genes associated with resistance, we conducted qRT-PCR experiment the expression level of pear seed plant under four abiotic stresses, including: ABA, dehydration, salt and cold treatment. One candidate PUB gene associated with dehydration stress was selected to conduct further functional experiment. Subcellular localization revealed PbrPUB18 protein was located on cell nucleus. Furthermore, heterologous over-expression of PbrPUB18 in Arabidopsis indicated that the over-expression of PbrPUB18 could enhance resistance in drought treatment.

"['This paper presents the interpersonal variability of harm challenge to Jerome Wakefield’s harmful-dysfunction account (HDA) of disorder. This challenge stems from the seeming fact that what promotes well-being or is harmful to someone varies much more across individuals than what is intuitively healthy or disordered. This makes it at least prima facie difficult to see how judgments about health and disorder could, as harm-requiring accounts of disorder like the HDA maintain, be based on, or closely linked to, judgments about well-being and harm. This interpersonal variability of harm challenge is made salient by the difficulty faced by harm-requiring accounts of disorder in dealing satisfactorily with cases of intuitively disordered conditions that seem harmless because they do not deprive the individuals that they affect of anything that they value (e.g., desired infertility). I argue that this challenge is made more serious for the HDA by some clarifications Wakefield has recently made on harm. In recent publications, Wakefield dissociates himself from the sheer cultural-relativist view of harm attributed to him by some critics based on his linkage of harm to social values, and adopts a more qualified social-values-based view of harm that leaves room for criticism of the values endorsed by members of a cultural group at a given time. I show how Wakefield’s qualified view makes it more difficult for the HDA to deal with the interpersonal variability of harm challenge, at least when applied to a Western cultural context where a high value is placed on autonomy and individual choice.']","['Dussault, Antoine C.']",['10.1007/s11019-021-10021-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11019-021-10021-8'],[''],"['The harmful-dysfunction account of disorder, individual versus social values, and the interpersonal variability of harm challenge']"

"['Background Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current indoor vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis . Methods The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus , and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control . Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function. Results All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68–73%.

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background The argasid tick Ornithodoros erraticus is the main vector of tick-borne human relapsing fever (TBRF) and African swine fever (ASF) in the Mediterranean Basin. Tick salivary proteins secreted to the host at the feeding interface play critical roles for tick feeding and may contribute to host infection by tick-borne pathogens; accordingly, these proteins represent interesting antigen targets for the development of vaccines aimed at the control and prevention of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases. Methods To identify these proteins, the transcriptome of the salivary glands of O. erraticus was de novo assembled and the salivary gene expression dynamics assessed throughout the trophogonic cycle using Illumina sequencing. The genes differentially upregulated after feeding were selected and discussed as potential antigen candidates for tick vaccines. Results Transcriptome assembly resulted in 22,007 transcripts and 18,961 annotated transcripts, which represent 86.15% of annotation success. Most salivary gene expression took place during the first 7 days after feeding (2088 upregulated transcripts), while only a few genes (122 upregulated transcripts) were differentially expressed from day 7 post-feeding onwards. The protein families more abundantly overrepresented after feeding were lipocalins, acid and basic tail proteins, proteases (particularly metalloproteases), protease inhibitors, secreted phospholipases A2, 5′-nucleotidases/apyrases and heme-binding vitellogenin-like proteins. All of them are functionally related to blood ingestion and regulation of host defensive responses, so they can be interesting candidate protective antigens for vaccines. Conclusions The O. erraticus sialotranscriptome contains thousands of protein coding sequences—many of them belonging to large conserved multigene protein families—and shows a complexity and functional redundancy similar to those observed in the sialomes of other argasid and ixodid tick species. This high functional redundancy emphasises the need for developing multiantigenic tick vaccines to reach full protection. This research provides a set of promising candidate antigens for the development of vaccines for the control of O. erraticus infestations and prevention of tick-borne diseases of public and veterinary health relevance, such as TBRF and ASF.

"['Background The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans , is a major blood-feeding pest of livestock that has near worldwide distribution, causing an annual cost of over $2 billion for control and product loss in the USA alone. Control of these flies has been limited to increased sanitary management practices and insecticide application for suppressing larval stages. Few genetic and molecular resources are available to help in developing novel methods for controlling stable flies. Results This study examines stable fly biology by utilizing a combination of high-quality genome sequencing and RNA-Seq analyses targeting multiple developmental stages and tissues. In conjunction, 1600 genes were manually curated to characterize genetic features related to stable fly reproduction, vector host interactions, host-microbe dynamics, and putative targets for control. Most notable was characterization of genes associated with reproduction and identification of expanded gene families with functional associations to vision, chemosensation, immunity, and metabolic detoxification pathways. Conclusions The combined sequencing, assembly, and curation of the male stable fly genome followed by RNA-Seq and downstream analyses provide insights necessary to understand the biology of this important pest. These resources and new data will provide the groundwork for expanding the tools available to control stable fly infestations.

Furthermore, our work provides insights on the African scenario of tick-symbiont associations, revealing the presence of Coxiella , Francisella and Midichloria across multiple tick populations. Coxiella endosymbionts were the most prevalent microorganisms, and that with the broadest spectrum of hosts, being detected in 16 tick species. Francisella was highly prevalent among the Hyalomma species tested and correlated negatively with the presence of Coxiella , showing a potential competitive interaction. Interestingly, we detected a positive association of Francisella with Rickettsia in specimens of Hy. rufipe s, suggesting a synergistic interaction between them.

This paper identifies and compares the infestation rate (prevalence and intensity) of females of hard tick species compared to males with respect to sex, age and breed of cattle in the region of Jijel, northeastern Algeria. A total of infested 53 cattle were screened and 1214 ticks were collected manually during summer 2019 (June, July and August) and identified based on their morphology. Seven tick species were identified as infesting the cattle: viz . Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus , Rhipicephalus bursa , Rhipicephalus sanguineus , Hyalomma marginatum , Hyalomma lusitanicum , Hyalomma scupense , and Hyalomma anatolicum . The predominant tick species recorded is Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus ) annulatus . The maximum intensity of tick infestation as a function of age is between 3 and 4\xa0years and 5 and 6\xa0years (39 ticks/cow). The study shows that the comparison between the prevalence of infestation in females and males is significant as a function of sex and breed of cattle. In addition, only the intensity of infestation as a function of the age of the cattle, when comparing the sexes of the ticks, is significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.05).

"[""Background Ticks (Arthropoda, Ixodida), after mosquitoes, are the second most prevalent vector of infectious diseases. They are responsible for spreading a multitude of pathogens and threatening the health and welfare of animals and human beings. However, given the history of tick-borne pathogen infections in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, surprisingly, neither the genetic diversity nor the spatial distribution of haplotypes within ticks has been studied. Methods We characterized the haplotype distribution of Dermacentor nuttalli in four main pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by sampling 109 individuals (recovered from sheep) in April–August 2019. The 16S rRNA gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) were amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA. Results Twenty-six haplotypes were identified using 16S rRNA sequences, 57 haplotypes were identified with COI sequences, and 75 haplotypes were identified with ITS2 sequences. Among the three genes, total haplotype diversity was greater than 0.7, while total nucleotide diversity was greater than 0.06. Neutrality tests revealed a significantly negative Tajima’s D result, while Fu's Fs was not significantly positive. Fixation index values (F ST ) indicated that the degree of genetic differentiation among some sampled populations was small, while for others it was moderate. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the variation within populations was greater than that among populations. The mismatch analysis of D. nuttalli exhibited double peaks. Conclusion The genetic diversity of D. nuttalli populations in our region can likely adapt to different geographical environments, thereby leading to genetic diversity, and creating genetic differentiation among different populations. However, genetic differentiation is cryptic and does not form a pedigree geographical structure.""]","['Gui, Zheng, [Wu, Lin], [Cai, Hao], [Mu, Lan], [Yu, Jing-Feng], [Fu, Shao-Yin], [Si, Xiao-Yan]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04625-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04625-5'],[''],"['Genetic diversity analysis of Dermacentor nuttalli within Inner Mongolia, China']"

Seven tick species are known to feed on bare-nosed wombats ( Vombatus ursinus ), in addition to the highly prevalent Sarcoptes scabiei mite which causes fatal sarcoptic mange in most bare-nosed wombat populations. Little is known about the pathogens carried by most wombat ticks or how they may impact wombats and wombat handlers. Methods Wombat ticks were sourced from wildlife hospitals and sanctuaries across Australia and identified to species level using taxonomic keys. Genomic DNA was extracted from a subsample, and following the amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3–V4 hypervariable region, next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform was used to assess the microbial composition. Results A total of 447 tick specimens were collected from 47 bare-nosed wombats between January 2019 and January 2020. Five species of ticks were identified comprising wombat tick Bothriocroton auruginans ( n = 420), wallaby tick Haemaphysalis bancrofti ( n = 8), bush tick Haemaphysalis longicornis ( n = 3), common marsupial tick Ixodes tasmani ( n = 12), and Australian paralysis tick Ixodes holocyclus ( n = 4). Tick infestations ranged from one to 73 ticks per wombat. The wombat tick was the most prevalent tick species comprising 94% of the total number of samples and was present on 97.9% (46/47) of wombat hosts. NGS results revealed the 16S rRNA gene diversity profile was predominantly Proteobacteria (55.1%) followed by Firmicutes (21.9%) and Actinobacteria (18.4%). A species of Coxiella sharing closest sequence identity to Coxiella burnetii (99.07%), was detected in 72% of B. auruginans and a Rickettsiella endosymbiont dominated the bacterial profile for I. tasmani . Conclusions A new host record for H. longicornis is the bare-nosed wombat. One adult male and two engorged adult female specimens were found on an adult male wombat from Coolagolite in New South Wales, and more specimens should be collected to confirm this host record. The most prevalent tick found on bare-nosed wombats was B. auruginans , confirming previous records.

"['Background The lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ), an important vector of a wide range of human and animal pathogens, is very common throughout the East and Midwest of the USA. Ticks are known to carry non-pathogenic bacteria that may play a role in their vector competence for pathogens. Several previous studies using the high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies reported the commensal bacteria in a tick midgut as abundant and diverse. In contrast, in our preliminary survey of the field collected adult lone star ticks, we found the number of culturable/viable bacteria very low. Methods We aimed to analyze the bacterial community of A. americanum by a parallel culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach applied to individual ticks. Results We analyzed 94 adult females collected in eastern Kansas and found that 60.8% of ticks had no culturable bacteria and the remaining ticks carried only 67.7\u2009±\u200942.8 colony-forming units (CFUs)/tick representing 26 genera. HTS of the 16S rRNA gene resulted in a total of 32 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with the dominant endosymbiotic genera Coxiella and Rickettsia (>\u200995%). Remaining OTUs with very low abundance were typical soil bacterial taxa indicating their environmental origin. Conclusions No correlation was found between the CFU abundance and the relative abundance from the culture-independent approach. This suggests that many culturable taxa detected by HTS but not by culture-dependent method were not viable or were not in their culturable state.

As there is no small laboratory animal model to study fatal human ehrlichiosis, Ehrlichia sp. HF provides a needed disease model. However, the inability to culture Ehrlichia sp. HF and the lack of genomic information have been a barrier to advance this animal model. In addition, Ehrlichia sp. HF has several designations in the literature as it lacks a taxonomically recognized name. Results We stably cultured Ehrlichia sp. HF in canine histiocytic leukemia DH82 cells from the HF strain-infected mice, and determined its complete genome sequence. Ehrlichia sp. HF has a single double-stranded circular chromosome of 1,148,904 bp, which encodes 866 proteins with a similar metabolic potential as E. chaffeensis . Ehrlichia sp. HF encodes homologs of all virulence factors identified in E. chaffeensis , including 23 paralogs of P28/OMP-1 family outer membrane proteins, type IV secretion system apparatus and effector proteins, two-component systems, ankyrin-repeat proteins, and tandem repeat proteins. Ehrlichia sp.

All the other carcasses were negative for the presence of subcutaneous ticks. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of a subcutaneous tick in a golden jackal. This finding broadens the host spectrum of subcutaneous ticks, and reinforces the idea that, among carnivores, this phenomenon only occurs in canids.']","['Mechouk, Noureddine, [Deak, Georgiana], [Ionică, Angela Monica], [Ionescu, Dan Traian], [Chișamera, Gabriel Bogdan], [Gherman, Călin Mircea], [Mihalca, Andrei Daniel]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04510-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04510-7'],[''],"['Subcutaneous ticks: a first report in a golden jackal, and their absence in non-canid carnivores']"

For males, the concentrations of different metabolites were relatively similar. In contrast, for females, concentrations of glycogen and carbohydrate were relatively low compared to those of protein and neutral lipids. Significant exponential declines in metabolite concentrations of all metabolites were detected over time for all life-cycle stages and at all temperatures. Nymphs generally showed lower rates of resource depletion than adults at all temperatures. The lower thresholds for metabolic activity were estimated to be between −10 and −5\xa0°C.

The prevalence of Wolbachia infection was detected in nymphs, females, and males with an infection rate of 55.8, 39.8, and 44%, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships were analyzed by comparing the sequences of wsp gene obtained from 60 strains of Wolbachia representing 11 strains of supergroup A and 10 strains of supergroup B.

After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks.

Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time.

With the aim of understanding evolutionary relationships and identifying reliable molecular characteristics that are specific for this order and its constituent genera, detailed phylogenetic and comparative analyses were conducted on the protein sequences from these genomes. A phylogenomic tree was constructed based on 393 single copy proteins that are commonly shared by the members of this order to delineate the evolutionary relationships among its members. In parallel, comparative analyses were performed on protein sequences from Legionellales genomes to identify novel molecular markers consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for different clades and genera. In the phylogenomic tree and in an amino acid identity matrix based on core proteins, members of the genera Aquicella , Coxiella, Legionella and Rickettsiella formed distinct clades confirming their monophyly.

"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca .

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

Comparison with classical OBPs reveals that the second of the six α-helices is lacking in VdesOBP1. Ligand-binding experiments revealed molecules able to bind only specific OBPs with a moderate affinity, suggesting that either optimal ligands have still to be identified, or post-translational modifications present in the native proteins may be essential for modulating binding activity, or else these OBPs might represent a failed attempt in evolution and are not used by the mites.']","['Amigues, Beatrice, [Zhu, Jiao], [Gaubert, Anais], [Arena, Simona], [Renzone, Giovanni], [Leone, Philippe], [Fischer, Isabella Maria], [Paulsen, Harald], [Knoll, Wolfgang], [Scaloni, Andrea], [Roussel, Alain], [Cambillau, Christian], [Pelosi, Paolo]']",['10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92604-2'],[''],['A new non-classical fold of varroa odorant-binding proteins reveals a wide open internal cavity']
"['Extracellular vesicles are thought to facilitate pathogen transmission from arthropods to humans and other animals. Here, we reveal that pathogen spreading from arthropods to the mammalian host is multifaceted. Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases. Extracellular vesicles have been implicated in the transmission of pathogens from the arthropod to the human host. Here the authors show that tick-derived extracellular vesicles play a role in feeding and modulate the outcome of bacterial infection.']","['Oliva Chávez, Adela S., [Wang, Xiaowei], [Marnin, Liron], [Archer, Nathan K.], [Hammond, Holly L.], [Carroll, Erin E.

"['Purpose Ehrlichiosis is one of the tick-borne diseases, which is not only neglected in Pakistan but only a few reports have been documented throughout the globe. The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease. The isolates from Pakistan Ehrlichia spp. Pakistan/31, 36, and 8 clustered with the isolates from the USA, Nicaraguan, France, South Africa, and Uganda.

"['Background The speed with which acaricides paralyze and kill ticks is relevant to impeding pathogen transmission. The objective of this study was to assess early-onset lotilaner effects on the motility and weights of Amblyomma americanum ticks collected from treated dogs. Methods Twelve healthy dogs were randomized between two groups to receive either lotilaner (Credelio ® ) on Day 0 or to be sham treated. On Day 7, 25 male and 25 female A. americanum were placed under bandages, two on each flank of each dog. After 30 or 45\xa0min, all unattached ticks were removed and T \u2009=\u20090 was set. At T \u2009=\u20092, 4, 8 and 24\xa0h post attachment, 5 attached ticks removed from each bandage on each dog were weighed, assessed by blinded observers for righting ability and movement recorded. Results After the infestation period significantly fewer treated than control dogs had 20 ticks attached (50.0% versus 91.7%, P \u2009=\u20090.0015). At 24\xa0h post attachment, mean weights of ticks from treated dogs (males 1.69\xa0mg; females 2.72) were significantly less than ticks from controls (males 2.66\xa0mg; females 4.67) ( P male \u2009=\u20090.0002; P female \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean tick weights from the treated group were significantly lower at 24\xa0h than at earlier time points ( P male \u2009<\u20090.0307; P female \u2009=\u20090.0021). At 4 and 8\xa0h, significantly fewer ticks from treated (14.3%, 0.0%, respectively) than from control dogs could right (73.3%, 70.0%) ( P 4h \u2009<\u20090.0001; P 8h \u2009=\u20090.0024) (at 24\xa0h, all ticks from treated dogs were dead), and distance moved was significantly less at all time points ( P 2h \u2009=\u20090.0413; P 4h , P 8h \u2009<\u20090.0001). Mean and maximum velocity of ticks from treated dogs were significantly lower, relative to controls, at 4 and 8\xa0h ( P \u2009≤\u20090.0001). Within the treated group, collected ticks had significantly lower mean and maximum velocities at 4 and 8\xa0h compared to 2\xa0h ( P mean \u2009<\u20090.0042; P max \u2009<\u20090.0194).

"['Purpose Coxiella burnetii is known for its potential as veterinary and human bacterial pathogen. The bacteria have been described in ticks, but their role in transmission of Q fever in humans is considered low. Coxiella endosymbionts closely related to C. burnetii have been also isolated from an extensive range of tick species and evidence is growing that these endosymbionts could be linked to human bacteremia. The aim of this study was to get new information on the presence of Coxiella species in ticks infesting wild and domestic hosts in Sardinia, Italy. Methods Here, 138 ticks collected from the study area were analyzed for the presence of C. burnetii and Coxiella- like bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing and philogenetic analyses using a set of primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Results DNA of Coxiella species was detected in 69% of the total ticks examined. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA Coxiella genotypes identified in this study grouped in strongly supported monophyletic clades with identified reference sequences of CLEs detected from Rhipicephalus , Dermacentor , Haemaphysalis and Ornithodoros species and with Coxiella burnetii strains isolated worldwide. Conclusion This study reports the molecular detection of a high diversity of Coxiella- like bacteria in Sardinian ticks and confirms also the presence of C. burnetii in tick species previously identified in the island.

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']

"['Background Relapsing fever (RF) borreliae are arthropod-borne spirochetes and some of them cause human diseases, which are characterized by relapsing or recurring episodes of fever. Recently, it has been classified into two groups: soft tick-borne RF (STRF) borreliae and hard tick-borne RF (HTRF) borreliae. STRF borreliae include classical RF agents and HTRF borreliae, the latter of which include B. miyamotoi , a human pathogen recently identified in Eurasia and North America. Results In this study, we determined the genome sequences of 16 HTRF borreliae strains: 15 B. miyamotoi strains (9 from Hokkaido Island, Japan, 3 from Honshu Island, Japan, and 3 from Mongolia) and a Borrelia sp. tHM16w. Chromosomal gene synteny was highly conserved among the HTRF strains sequenced in this study, even though they were isolated from different geographic regions and different tick species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sequences revealed that HTRF and STRF borreliae are clearly distinguishable, with each forming a monophyletic group in the RF borreliae lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary relationships of RF borreliae are consistent with the biological and ecological features of each RF borreliae sublineage and can explain the unique characteristics of Borrelia anserina . In addition, the pairwise genetic distances between HTRF borreliae strains were well correlated with those of vector species rather than with the geographical distances between strain isolation sites. This result suggests that the genetic diversification of HTRF borreliae is attributed to the speciation of vector ticks and that this relationship might be required for efficient transmission of HTRF borreliae within vector ticks. Conclusions The results of the present study, together with those from previous investigations, support the hypothesis that the common ancestor of borreliae was transmitted by hard-bodied ticks and that only STRF borreliae switched to using soft-bodied ticks as a vector, which was followed by the emergence of Borrelia recurrentis , lice-borne RF borreliae. Our study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships between RF borreliae, and the data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of RF borreliae.']","['Nakao, Ranna, [Kasama, Kentaro], [Boldbaatar, Bazartseren], [Ogura, Yoshitoshi], [Kawabata, Hiroki], [Toyoda, Atsushi], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Maeda, Ken]']",['10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],[''],['The evolution of hard tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae is correlated with vector species rather than geographical distance']
"['Background African tick bite fever (ATBF) caused by Rickettsia africae and transmitted by Amblyomma spp. ticks is one of the zoonotic tick-borne fevers from the spotted fever group (SFG) of rickettsiae, which is an emerging global health concern. There is paucity of information regarding the occurrence and awareness of the disease in endemic rural livestock farming communities living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. Methods The purpose of the study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices on ticks and ATBF infection from a community living in livestock-wildlife interface areas in South Africa. A focus group discussion (FGD) was carried out followed by verbal administration of a standardized semi-structured questionnaire a month later to 38 rural livestock farmers (23 from Caquba area and 15 from Lucingweni area where A. hebraeum was absent). An FGD was conducted in Caquba (situated at the livestock-wildlife interface where Amblyomma hebraeum was prevalent on cattle and infected with Rickettsia africae ) in the O.R. Tambo district of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Results Results from the FGD and questionnaire survey showed that participants from the two rural communities were not aware of ATBF and were not aware that ticks are vectors of the disease. Respondents from Caquba reported of having frequent exposure to tick bites (91.3%, 21/23) specifically from the anthropophilic A. hebrauem which they were able to identify as Qwelagqibe in IsiXhosa (their vernacular). Thirteen out of 15 (86.7%) of respondents from Lucingweni reported that they had never been bitten by ticks, which corresponded with the absence of A. hebraeum from their locality as evidenced from results of a concurrent study on prevalence of ticks on livestock in the area. Both communities confirmed to being “very concerned” of tick bites and we presume this was more related to the localized wounds from the bites than to the diseases transmitted by the ticks.

Methods The adult Dermacentor nuttalli ( n \u2009=\u2009203) and Ixodes persulcatus ( n \u2009=\u200936) ticks feeding on cattle were collected. The pooled DNA samples prepared from these ticks were sequenced as the templates for mNGS to survey the presence of TBPs at the genus level.

"['Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii , which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus . Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii -infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii -infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival. A retrospective power analysis found that our sampling effort had sufficient power (>\u200980%) to detect small effects (differences of 5% to 10%) of our treatments.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']
"['Forests in eastern North America are experiencing high densities of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and encroachment by invasive plants, both of which threaten native biodiversity. We review the literature on deer and invasive plant impacts focusing on studies that simultaneously evaluate the consequences of both. Deer have more frequent and more consistently negative effects than invasive plants. Widespread deer impacts now threaten many native plant species through much of their range. In contrast, invasive plant effects currently remain more localized and/or of smaller extent within forests. Deer impacts are also cumulative, hitting preferred plant species especially hard as they decline in density. This generates difficult-to-reverse legacy effects. Invasive plant effects, in contrast, tend to be more diffuse and may be more readily reversed. High deer populations also shift physical and chemical conditions in soils promoting “invasion cascades” involving non-native earthworms and certain introduced plants. Removing invasive plants without reducing deer populations can increase deer impacts on native species. Management should be integrated to address both deer and invasive plants. To safeguard and restore native biota when resources are limited, however, it may be most effective for managers to first reduce deer populations before investing in efforts to reduce invasive populations (except when invasions are at an early stage). We should rethink and reform traditional approaches to managing deer so that we can better integrate land vegetation with wildlife management to achieve broad public objectives.

"['Background Recreational trails abound across the United States and represent high risk areas for tick exposure. Although online reviews represent a rich source of user information, they have rarely been used in determining the risk of tick exposure during recreational trail use. Based on online user reviews and comments, the purpose of this study was to determine risk factors and behavioral recommendations associated with tick encounters ( Tick Presence ) on recreational trails in the state of Indiana, U.S. Methods We reviewed 26,016 user comments left on AllTrails.com for 697 Indiana trails. Reviews were evaluated to determine Tick Presence/Absence , the total number of Tick Presence Reviews per trail, and multiple trail and user behavioral characteristics. We used hot spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis to test the hypothesis of whether there are clusters in the number of Tick Presence Reviews . Pearson chi-square tests of independence evaluated whether tick presence was associated with several trail characteristics. Finally, negative binomial regression evaluated the strength of the association between the number of Tick Presence Reviews and several trail characteristics. Results Tick Presence was recorded at 10% ( n \u2009=\u200965) of trails and occurred most frequently in May. Hot spot analysis revealed statistically significant clusters of Tick Presence Reviews on trails in the Southern Indiana State Region . Results of χ 2 tests indicated significant associations between Tick Presence Reviews and (a) State Region and (b) Land Management Type ; Mann-Whitney U tests detected significant differences in Tick Presence Reviews based on Trail Length and Elevation Gain. Subsequent results of a negative binomial regression model indicated that Southern Indiana State Region, Federal and Private Land Management Type , and Elevation Gain were factors significantly associated with Tick Presence Reviews. Content of user reviews indicated several behaviors employed to prevent tick encounters, particularly Repellent Application and Recreational Deterrenc e; 25% included a behavior Recommendation to others. Conclusions Online, user-generated trail reviews have the potential to serve as rich data sources for identifying recreational trails, where 1) the risk of tick exposure is great, 2) more robust active tick and tick-borne pathogen surveillance may be warranted, and 3) tailored prevention interventions are needed.']","['Anderson, Kristina R., [Blekking, Jordan], [Omodior, Oghenekaro]']",['10.1186/s12889-021-10940-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10940-4'],[''],['Tick trails: the role of online recreational trail reviews in identifying risk factors and behavioral recommendations associated with tick encounters in Indiana']

"['Background Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current indoor vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis . Methods The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus , and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control . Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function. Results All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68–73%. Conclusions These results were the first to show that hosts vaccinated with recombinant Akirin vaccines could develop a protective response against this outdoor malaria transmission vector, thus providing a step towards the development of a novel intervention for An. arabiensis vector control.

"['Background The salmon louse ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) is a parasite of salmonid fish. Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) exhibit only a limited and ineffective immune response when infested with this parasite. Prostaglandins (PGs) have many biological functions in both invertebrates and vertebrates, one of which is the regulation of immune responses. This has led to the suggestion that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) is important in the salmon louse host–parasite interaction, although studies of a salmon louse prostaglandin E 2 synthase ( PGES ) 2 gene have not enabled conformation of this hypothesis. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to characterize two additional PGES-like genes. Methods Lepeophtheirus salmonis microsomal glutathione S -transferase 1 like ( LsMGST1L ) and LsPGES3L were investigated by sequencing, phylogenetics, transcript localization and expression studies. Moreover,\xa0the function of\xa0these putative PGES genes in addition to\xa0the previously identified LsPGES2 gene was analyzed\xa0in double stranded (ds) RNA-mediated\xa0knockdown (KD)\xa0salmon louse. Results Analysis of the three putative LsPGES genes showed a rather constitutive transcript level throughout development from nauplius to the adult stages, and in a range of tissues, with the highest levels in the ovaries or gut. DsRNA-mediated KD of these transcripts did not produce any characteristic changes in phenotype, and KD animals displayed a normal reproductive output. The ability of the parasite to infect or modulate the immune response of the host fish was also not affected by KD. Conclusions Salmon louse prostaglandins may play endogenous roles in the management of reproduction and oxidative stress and may be a product of salmon louse blood digestions.

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

Therefore, this systematic meta-analysis review summarizes the above-detailed human infestation spectrums about biological stages of hard ticks. Methods After a preliminary review from 605 papers representing areas of the study objectives, 96 were selected for detailed human infestation spectrums of biological stages of hard ticks. Results In general, the results suggest that the adult ticks, and mostly females attack humans more than larval and nymphalid ones, and adult males, respectively. Unlike the trends of human infestation by larval and nymphalid stages of ticks, and the adult, male and female ticks which exhibited approximately a sharply decreasing trend, the global trend of human infestation by hard ticks exhibited approximately a sharply increasing trend over time. Ticks attack humans more in rural area than urban area. Also, the trends of human tick infestation in rural and urban areas exhibit, respectively, a sharp increase and decrease trends over time.

"['Background The argasid tick Ornithodoros erraticus is the main vector of tick-borne human relapsing fever (TBRF) and African swine fever (ASF) in the Mediterranean Basin. Tick salivary proteins secreted to the host at the feeding interface play critical roles for tick feeding and may contribute to host infection by tick-borne pathogens; accordingly, these proteins represent interesting antigen targets for the development of vaccines aimed at the control and prevention of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases. Methods To identify these proteins, the transcriptome of the salivary glands of O. erraticus was de novo assembled and the salivary gene expression dynamics assessed throughout the trophogonic cycle using Illumina sequencing. The genes differentially upregulated after feeding were selected and discussed as potential antigen candidates for tick vaccines. Results Transcriptome assembly resulted in 22,007 transcripts and 18,961 annotated transcripts, which represent 86.15% of annotation success. Most salivary gene expression took place during the first 7 days after feeding (2088 upregulated transcripts), while only a few genes (122 upregulated transcripts) were differentially expressed from day 7 post-feeding onwards. The protein families more abundantly overrepresented after feeding were lipocalins, acid and basic tail proteins, proteases (particularly metalloproteases), protease inhibitors, secreted phospholipases A2, 5′-nucleotidases/apyrases and heme-binding vitellogenin-like proteins. All of them are functionally related to blood ingestion and regulation of host defensive responses, so they can be interesting candidate protective antigens for vaccines. Conclusions The O. erraticus sialotranscriptome contains thousands of protein coding sequences—many of them belonging to large conserved multigene protein families—and shows a complexity and functional redundancy similar to those observed in the sialomes of other argasid and ixodid tick species. This high functional redundancy emphasises the need for developing multiantigenic tick vaccines to reach full protection. This research provides a set of promising candidate antigens for the development of vaccines for the control of O. erraticus infestations and prevention of tick-borne diseases of public and veterinary health relevance, such as TBRF and ASF.

The Ikeda strain of T. orientalis is more virulent than other strains, leading to severe clinical signs and death of up to 5% of affected animals. Within the Asia–Pacific region, where it affects 25% of Australian cattle, T. orientalis Ikeda has a significant economic impact on the cattle industry. In 2017, T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in a cattle herd in Albermarle County, Virginia, United States. Months earlier, the U.S. was alerted to the invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, throughout the eastern U.S. Abundant H. longicornis ticks were identified on cattle in the T. orientalis- affected herd in VA, and a subset of ticks from the environment were PCR-positive for T. orientalis Ikeda. A strain of T. orientalis from a previous U.S. outbreak was not transmissible by H. longicornis ; however, H. longicornis is the primary tick vector of T. orientalis Ikeda in other regions of the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether invasive H. longicornis ticks in the U.S. are competent vectors of T. orientalis Ikeda. Methods Nymphal H. longicornis ticks were fed on a splenectomized calf infected with the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. After molting, a subset of adult ticks from this cohort were dissected, and salivary glands assayed for T. orientalis Ikeda via qPCR. The remaining adult ticks from the group were allowed to feed on three calves. Calves were subsequently monitored for T. orientalis Ikeda infection via blood smear cytology and PCR. Results After acquisition feeding on a VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda-infected calf as nymphs, a subset of molted adult tick salivary glands tested positive by qPCR for T. orientalis Ikeda. Adult ticks from the same cohort successfully transmitted T. orientalis Ikeda to 3/3 naïve calves, each of which developed parasitemia reaching 0.4–0.9%. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that U.S. H. longicornis ticks are competent vectors of the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. This data provides important information for the U.S. cattle industry regarding the potential spread of this parasite and the necessity of enhanced surveillance and control measures.']","['Dinkel, Kelcey D., [Herndon, David R.], [Noh, Susan M.], [Lahmers, Kevin K.], [Todd, S.

"['Background The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans , is a major blood-feeding pest of livestock that has near worldwide distribution, causing an annual cost of over $2 billion for control and product loss in the USA alone. Control of these flies has been limited to increased sanitary management practices and insecticide application for suppressing larval stages. Few genetic and molecular resources are available to help in developing novel methods for controlling stable flies. Results This study examines stable fly biology by utilizing a combination of high-quality genome sequencing and RNA-Seq analyses targeting multiple developmental stages and tissues. In conjunction, 1600 genes were manually curated to characterize genetic features related to stable fly reproduction, vector host interactions, host-microbe dynamics, and putative targets for control. Most notable was characterization of genes associated with reproduction and identification of expanded gene families with functional associations to vision, chemosensation, immunity, and metabolic detoxification pathways. Conclusions The combined sequencing, assembly, and curation of the male stable fly genome followed by RNA-Seq and downstream analyses provide insights necessary to understand the biology of this important pest. These resources and new data will provide the groundwork for expanding the tools available to control stable fly infestations. The close relationship of Stomoxys to other blood-feeding (horn flies and Glossina ) and non-blood-feeding flies (house flies, medflies, Drosophila ) will facilitate understanding of the evolutionary processes associated with development of blood feeding among the Cyclorrhapha.']","['Olafson, Pia U., [Aksoy, Serap], [Attardo, Geoffrey M.], [Buckmeier, Greta], [Chen, Xiaoting], [Coates, Craig J.], [Davis, Megan], [Dykema, Justin], [Emrich, Scott J.], [Friedrich, Markus], [Holmes, Christopher J.], [Ioannidis, Panagiotis], [Jansen, Evan N.], [Jennings, Emily C.], [Lawson, Daniel], [Martinson, Ellen O.], [Maslen, Gareth L.], [Meisel, Richard P.], [Murphy, Terence D.], [Nayduch, Dana], [Nelson, David R.], [Oyen, Kennan J.], [Raszick, Tyler J.], [Ribeiro, José M.

"['Purpose The erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion is often the first clinical sign of Lyme disease. Significant variability in EM presenting characteristics such as shape, color, pattern, and homogeneity, has been reported. We studied associations between these presenting characteristics, as well as whether they were associated with age, sex, EM duration, body location, and initiation of antibiotics. Methods Two hundred and seventy one adult participants with early Lyme disease who had a physician-diagnosed EM skin lesion of\u2009≥\u20095\xa0cm in diameter and\u2009≤\u200972\xa0h of antibiotic treatment were enrolled. Participant demographics, clinical characteristics, and characteristics of their primary EM lesion were recorded. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, EM size increased along with increasing EM duration to a peak of 14\xa0days. Male EM were found to be on average 2.18\xa0cm larger than female EM. The odds of a red (vs blue/red) EM were 65% lower in males compared to females, and were over 3 times as high for EM found on the pelvis, torso, or arm compared to the leg. Age remained a significant predictor of central clearing in adjusted models; for every 10-year increase in age, the odds of central clearing decreased 25%. Conclusions Given that EM remains a clinical diagnosis, it is essential that both physicians and the general public are aware of its varied manifestations. Our findings suggest possible patterns within this variability, with implications for prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation, as well as an understanding of the clinical spectrum of EM.']","['Rebman, Alison W., [Yang, Ting], [Mihm, Erica A.], [Novak, Cheryl B.], [Yoon, Isaac], [Powell, Debra], [Geller, Steven A.], [Aucott, John N.]']",['10.1007/s15010-021-01590-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01590-0'],[''],"['The presenting characteristics of erythema migrans vary by age, sex, duration, and body location']"
"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']

Furthermore, our work provides insights on the African scenario of tick-symbiont associations, revealing the presence of Coxiella , Francisella and Midichloria across multiple tick populations. Coxiella endosymbionts were the most prevalent microorganisms, and that with the broadest spectrum of hosts, being detected in 16 tick species. Francisella was highly prevalent among the Hyalomma species tested and correlated negatively with the presence of Coxiella , showing a potential competitive interaction.

"[""Background Ticks (Arthropoda, Ixodida), after mosquitoes, are the second most prevalent vector of infectious diseases. They are responsible for spreading a multitude of pathogens and threatening the health and welfare of animals and human beings. However, given the history of tick-borne pathogen infections in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, surprisingly, neither the genetic diversity nor the spatial distribution of haplotypes within ticks has been studied. Methods We characterized the haplotype distribution of Dermacentor nuttalli in four main pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by sampling 109 individuals (recovered from sheep) in April–August 2019. The 16S rRNA gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) were amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA. Results Twenty-six haplotypes were identified using 16S rRNA sequences, 57 haplotypes were identified with COI sequences, and 75 haplotypes were identified with ITS2 sequences. Among the three genes, total haplotype diversity was greater than 0.7, while total nucleotide diversity was greater than 0.06. Neutrality tests revealed a significantly negative Tajima’s D result, while Fu's Fs was not significantly positive. Fixation index values (F ST ) indicated that the degree of genetic differentiation among some sampled populations was small, while for others it was moderate. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the variation within populations was greater than that among populations. The mismatch analysis of D. nuttalli exhibited double peaks. Conclusion The genetic diversity of D. nuttalli populations in our region can likely adapt to different geographical environments, thereby leading to genetic diversity, and creating genetic differentiation among different populations.

"['Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ( RhIAP ) . The RhIAP ORF of 1887\xa0bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48\xa0h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate.

"['Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m 2 ) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m 2 ) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.']","['Hansford, Kayleigh M., [McGinley, Liz], [Wilkinson, Samantha], [Gillingham, Emma L.], [Cull, Ben], [Gandy, Sara], [Carter, Daniel P.], [Vaux, Alexander G.

"['The seabird tick, Ixodes uriae , is a significant ectoparasite of penguins in Antarctica and of other seabirds, mainly in coastal, polar regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but the tick’s distribution extends into more temperate regions as well. The expansive range of this tick suggests that it is exposed to a wide range of abiotic stresses, including dehydration, heat, and cold. To better understand how I. uriae responds to stress exposure, we examined cross-tolerance between dehydration and thermal stress based on survival analyses and used RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional responses to cold, heat, and dehydration. Slight dehydration improved cold, but not heat tolerance, whereas severe dehydration reduced subsequent thermal tolerance. Dehydration exposure prompted transcript-level shifts underlying protein metabolism, recovery from stress, and processes allowing subsequent rehydration by water vapor uptake. Both cold and heat stress yielded expression changes involved in cuticle modification. One gene increased in expression (enzyme P450) and one decreased (transcription factor Hairy) in response to all three stresses.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

"['Background Birds are major hosts for many tick species (Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and their role is especially important in transporting ticks over large distances along their seasonal migratory routes. Accordingly, most studies across Europe focus on the importance of avian hosts in tick dispersal, and less emphasis is laid on resident birds and their role in supporting tick life cycles. Eurasian eagle owls ( Bubo bubo ) exemplify the latter, but all the few studies on their tick infestation were carried out in Western Europe and even those did not involve a large sample size and did not assess infestation prevalence in natural habitats. Methods In this study, 320 ixodid ticks were collected from nestlings of Eurasian eagle owls during the period 2018–2020 in Bulgaria in south-eastern Europe. These ticks were analysed morphologically, and selected specimens molecularly based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( cox 1) gene. The effects of environmental and habitat-related conditions and of the species of prey eaten by eagle owls on tick infestation were also evaluated. Results The majority of ticks were identified as adults of Rhipicephalus turanicus ( n \u2009=\u2009296). In addition, 15 Hyalomma marginatum (three males, 11 nymphs and a larva), one female of Haemaphysalis erinacei and of Ha. punctata , and a nymph of Ixodes ricinus were found. Among R. turanicus , two distinct morphotypes were observed, but they do not form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial gene cox1. We found a positive correlation between the total number of ticks on nestlings from a particular nest and the number of medium-sized to large prey mammals brought to the nestling owls. Also, the most important predictor for tick abundance was the effect of the extent of arable land (negative), while forests and grasslands contributed less, with no effect observed in case of urbanized areas and watercourses. Conclusions The intensity of tick infestation can be high on nestling Eurasian eagle owls (mean intensity 16.59\xa0ticks/nestling). In this study, five different tick species were recorded, among which R. turanicus dominated. Two male morphotypes of this tick species were found, but their morphological differences were not reflected by genetic diversity or phylogenetic clustering. The most important factor determining tick abundance was the land-use structure.

"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18\xa0mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde have the potential to be developed into botanical-based larvicidal and nymphicidal agents for tick control.

"['In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape.']","['Conte, Christine E., [Leahy, Jessica E.], [Gardner, Allison M.]']",['10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-021-01531-1'],[''],['Active Forest Management Reduces Blacklegged Tick and Tick-Borne Pathogen Exposure Risk']

"['The search for relatively safe pesticides to control pests continues to reduce the damage they cause and avoid the negative effects of pesticides on the environment. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, is the most dangerous pest on palm trees of all kinds, especially in arid areas. Ivermectin (IVM), an analog of abamectin, shows physiological efficacy against insects at very low concentrations. This study was performed to evaluate the biochemical and histopathological effects of sublethal concentrations of IVM on cells of the testes and ovaries of R. ferrugineus . Mortality resulting from feeding IVM at concentrations of 2, 1, 0.5 0.25, 0.125 and 0.0625\xa0ppm was estimated. The LC50 was calculated as 0.685\xa0ppm for males and 1.23\xa0ppm for females.

The histopathological effects of IVM concentrations of 0.25, 1 and 2\xa0ppm indicate that IVM induced apoptosis in subcellular organelles of the testis and ovary.

Also, an analysis of mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences was performed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of these tick species. Adults and nymphs of O. clarki and O. rondoniensis are unique among the Argasidae family by presenting exceptionally large spiracular plates with small goblets, and an integument with smooth polygonal mammillae. However, these two species are morphologically distinct based on specific patterns of coxal folds, idiosomal mammillae and pilosity, and female genital flap. In contrast, the larvae of O. clarki and O. rondoniensis are morphologically identical, except for a general larger size of the former species; this slight difference is corroborated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using 40 morphometric variables. Phylogenetic analyses including 16S rDNA partial sequences of different Ornithodoros taxa from Central and South America indicate that O. rondoniensis from Brazil diverges from O. clarki from Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama. However, phylogenetic distance separating both alleged species is similar or slightly lower than the distances depicted for conspecific populations of a few other Ornithodoros species.

Methods In this study, 36 RPW individuals were collected from 6 different locations in Egypt. The presences of endosymbionts in the RPW individuals were assayed. The phylogenetic analysis of the RPW inhabiting Egypt was conducted using Cytochrome c oxidase sub-unit 1 ( CO1 ) gene. Results Spiroplasma was found, for the first time, in all individuals, while Rickettsia was found, for the first time, in individuals collected from only 3 of the 6 locations . Endosymbionts harbouring Egyptian RPW were closely related to those harbouring Diptera and\\or Trombidiformes associated with palm trees. This may be due to horizontal transmission through palm sap or through ectoparasites living on the RPW. Finally, the phylogenetic analysis of the RPW inhabiting Egypt was conducted. The collected individuals were closely related to Saudi Arabia specimens collected from the eastern region. Thus, Saudi Arabia may be the origin of the RPW which invaded Egypt. Individuals from populations inhabiting the same geographical locations were closely related. This may be due to secondary invasion incidents that may have taken place through transportation of infested date palm trees and offshoots from infected to uninfected locations. Conclusion This study reports the first incidence for the presence and coexistence of Spiroplasma and Rickettsia in RPW collected from Egypt.

To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis. Discussion This article describes the background and design of the study protocol of ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’. With our study we hope to provide insight into the prevalence, clinical presentation and disease burden of the tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis, babesiosis, B. miyamotoi disease, neoehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and tick-borne encephalitis and to assist in test development as well as provide recommendations for national guidelines.

In this study, we investigated the presence of Ixodiphagus hookeri in Haemaphysalis concinna and Ixodes ricinus ticks in the Slovak Karst (southern Slovakia) and analysed the ecological and physiological relationships in the parasitoid-host system. Unfed H. concinna and I. ricinus nymphs harvested from vegetation were fed on rabbits. The engorged specimens were kept at 25\xa0°C and 75% RH until the emergence of the adult wasps. For the first time in Europe, we found the presence of I. hookeri in two species of ticks collected in the same locality and compared their development in these tick species. The prevalence of wasps in H. concinna and I. ricinus during their spring activity was estimated at 10.64% and 27.78%, respectively. The presence of the wasps did not affect the duration of nymph feeding. Engorged wasp-infected ticks achieved higher body mass than non-infected specimens. In both tick species, there were no differences in the length of the development period and the number and sex ratio of adult I. hookeri .

This study presents the seasonal pattern, risk factors, and case notes on human otoacariasis in two climatically different districts: Anuradhapura and Kandy in the Dry and Wet/Intermediate zone of Sri Lanka, respectively. Methods Ticks removed from the ear canal of patients were collected. Risk factors of otoacarisis were determined by a case/control follow-up study. Results Nymphal Dermacentor auratus (90.8%) was the main tick species associated otoacariasis. In the Kandy District, infestation was year-round, while in the Anuradhapura District, it was seasonal with a peak in December–February.

"['Background Ticks of the genus Hyalomma , which are vectors for several tick-borne diseases, are occasionally found in areas outside their endemic range including northern parts of Europe. The objective of this study was to analyse adult Hyalomma ticks that were recently found in the Netherlands. Methods Hyalomma ticks were morphologically identified. Cluster analysis, based upon sequence data ( cox1 barcoding) for molecular identification, and pathogen detection\xa0were performed. Additionally, a cross-sectional survey of horses was conducted to actively search for Hyalomma ticks in summer 2019. Analysis of temperature was done to assess the possibility of (i) introduced engorged nymphs moulting to adults and (ii) establishment of populations in the Netherlands. Results Seventeen adult Hyalomma ticks (one in 2018, eleven in 2019, five in 2020) were found by citizens and reported. Fifteen ticks were detected on horses and two on humans. Twelve were identified as H. marginatum , one as H. rufipes and four, of which only photographic images were available, as Hyalomma sp. No Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus or Babesia / Theileria parasites were detected. One adult tick tested positive for Rickettsia aeschlimannii . In the cross-sectional horse survey, no Hyalomma ticks were found. Analysis of temperatures showed that engorged nymphs arriving on migratory birds in spring were able to moult to adults in 2019 and 2020, and that cumulative daily temperatures in the Netherlands were lower than in areas with established H. marginatum populations. Conclusions Our results show that Hyalomma ticks are regularly introduced in the Netherlands as nymphs. Under the Dutch weather conditions,\xa0these nymphs\xa0are able to develop to the adult stage, which\xa0can be sighted by vigilant citizens. Only one human pathogen, Rickettsia aeschlimannii , was found in one of the ticks. The risk of introduction of tick-borne diseases via Hyalomma ticks on migratory birds is considered to be low.

"['Purpose The tick-borne protozoa piroplasms, including Theileria and Babesia , are the cause of substantial economic losses to the livestock industry. However, in southern Qinghai province, China, there are limited information on the molecular characteristics of piroplasms. This study therefore aimed at determining the prevalence and genetic diversity of piroplasms. Methods In order to detect piroplasms, we examined 330 yaks and 236 Tibetan sheep blood samples by nested PCR. The differences in piroplasms prevalence in relation to different risk factors was analyzed using SPSS 26. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA sequences was inferred using MEGA 7. Results During this study, Theileria spp . were detected in 33.6% (111/330) of yaks and 94.1% (222/236) of Tibetan sheep, but no Babesia was identified. Importantly, a comparison study revealed that T. ovis infection was highly prevalent in sheep (94.1%) but infrequent in yaks (6.1%), while T. sinensis was host-specific to yaks with an infection rate of 27.6%. In addition, male animals were more likely to be infected by T. sinensis and female animals were more likely to be infected by T. ovis . And animals below 4000\xa0m areas reported a higher infection rate with T. sinensis (26.1% vs. 2.9%, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Alongside these differences in prevalence, we found a significantly higher T. sinensis infection rate in separated-grazing livestock (22.2% vs. 3.7%, p \u2009<\u20090.001), while mixed-grazing ruminants had a higher T. ovis infection rate (50.0% vs. 39.0%, p \u2009=\u20090.014). Furthermore, sequence analysis revealed that the 18S rRNA sequences obtained in this study shared 86.9–100.0% identities with each other and they were clustered into T. sinensis or T. ovis . Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. sinensis in Qinghai region. In addition, high prevalence of the generally sub-clinical T. ovis in sheep indicates extensive exposure to ticks and transmission of tick-borne pathogens with a significant economic impact.

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background The argasid tick Ornithodoros erraticus is the main vector of tick-borne human relapsing fever (TBRF) and African swine fever (ASF) in the Mediterranean Basin. Tick salivary proteins secreted to the host at the feeding interface play critical roles for tick feeding and may contribute to host infection by tick-borne pathogens; accordingly, these proteins represent interesting antigen targets for the development of vaccines aimed at the control and prevention of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases. Methods To identify these proteins, the transcriptome of the salivary glands of O. erraticus was de novo assembled and the salivary gene expression dynamics assessed throughout the trophogonic cycle using Illumina sequencing. The genes differentially upregulated after feeding were selected and discussed as potential antigen candidates for tick vaccines. Results Transcriptome assembly resulted in 22,007 transcripts and 18,961 annotated transcripts, which represent 86.15% of annotation success. Most salivary gene expression took place during the first 7 days after feeding (2088 upregulated transcripts), while only a few genes (122 upregulated transcripts) were differentially expressed from day 7 post-feeding onwards. The protein families more abundantly overrepresented after feeding were lipocalins, acid and basic tail proteins, proteases (particularly metalloproteases), protease inhibitors, secreted phospholipases A2, 5′-nucleotidases/apyrases and heme-binding vitellogenin-like proteins. All of them are functionally related to blood ingestion and regulation of host defensive responses, so they can be interesting candidate protective antigens for vaccines. Conclusions The O. erraticus sialotranscriptome contains thousands of protein coding sequences—many of them belonging to large conserved multigene protein families—and shows a complexity and functional redundancy similar to those observed in the sialomes of other argasid and ixodid tick species. This high functional redundancy emphasises the need for developing multiantigenic tick vaccines to reach full protection. This research provides a set of promising candidate antigens for the development of vaccines for the control of O. erraticus infestations and prevention of tick-borne diseases of public and veterinary health relevance, such as TBRF and ASF. Additionally, this transcriptome constitutes a valuable reference database for proteomics studies of the saliva and salivary glands of O. erraticus .']","['Pérez-Sánchez, Ricardo, [Carnero-Morán, Ángel], [Soriano, Beatriz], [Llorens, Carlos], [Oleaga, Ana]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04671-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04671-z'],[''],['RNA-seq analysis and gene expression dynamics in the salivary glands of the argasid tick Ornithodoros erraticus along the trophogonic cycle']

"['Background During the last decades a northward and upward range shift has been observed among many organisms across different taxa. In the northern hemisphere, ticks have been observed to have increased their latitudinal and altitudinal range limit. However, the elevational expansion at its northern distribution range remains largely unstudied. In this study we investigated the altitudinal distribution of the exophilic Ixodes ricinus and endophilic I. trianguliceps on two mountain slopes in Norway by assessing larval infestation rates on bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ). Methods During 2017 and 2018, 1325 bank voles were captured during the spring, summer and autumn at ten trapping stations ranging from 100 m to 1000 m.a.s.l. in two study areas in southern Norway. We used generalized logistic regression models to estimate the prevalence of infestation of both tick species along gradients of altitude, considering study area, collection year and season, temperature, humidity and altitude interactions as extrinsic variables, and host body mass and sex as intrinsic predictor variables. Results We found that both I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps infested bank voles at altitudes up to 1000 m.a.s.l., which is a substantial increase in altitude compared to previous findings for I. ricinus in this region. The infestation rates declined more rapidly with increasing altitude for I. ricinus compared to I. trianguliceps , indicating that the endophilic ecology of I. trianguliceps may provide shelter from limiting factors tied to altitude.

Conclusions This study provides new insights into the altitudinal distribution of two tick species at their northern distribution range, one with the potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens to both humans and livestock. With warming temperatures predicted to increase, and especially so in the northern regions, the risk of tick-borne infections is likely to become a concern at increasingly higher altitudes in the future.']","['Pelsmaeker, Nicolas, [Korslund, Lars], [Steifetten, Øyvind]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04604-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04604-w'],[''],"['High-elevational occurrence of two tick species, Ixodes ricinus and I. trianguliceps, at their northern distribution range']"
"['Background Theileria orientalis is a tick-borne hemoparasite that causes anemia, ill thrift, and death in cattle globally. The Ikeda strain of T. orientalis is more virulent than other strains, leading to severe clinical signs and death of up to 5% of affected animals. Within the Asia–Pacific region, where it affects 25% of Australian cattle, T. orientalis Ikeda has a significant economic impact on the cattle industry. In 2017, T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in a cattle herd in Albermarle County, Virginia, United States. Months earlier, the U.S. was alerted to the invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, throughout the eastern U.S. Abundant H. longicornis ticks were identified on cattle in the T. orientalis- affected herd in VA, and a subset of ticks from the environment were PCR-positive for T. orientalis Ikeda. A strain of T. orientalis from a previous U.S. outbreak was not transmissible by H. longicornis ; however, H. longicornis is the primary tick vector of T. orientalis Ikeda in other regions of the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether invasive H. longicornis ticks in the U.S. are competent vectors of T. orientalis Ikeda. Methods Nymphal H. longicornis ticks were fed on a splenectomized calf infected with the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. After molting, a subset of adult ticks from this cohort were dissected, and salivary glands assayed for T. orientalis Ikeda via qPCR. The remaining adult ticks from the group were allowed to feed on three calves. Calves were subsequently monitored for T. orientalis Ikeda infection via blood smear cytology and PCR. Results After acquisition feeding on a VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda-infected calf as nymphs, a subset of molted adult tick salivary glands tested positive by qPCR for T. orientalis Ikeda. Adult ticks from the same cohort successfully transmitted T. orientalis Ikeda to 3/3 naïve calves, each of which developed parasitemia reaching 0.4–0.9%. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that U.S. H. longicornis ticks are competent vectors of the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. This data provides important information for the U.S. cattle industry regarding the potential spread of this parasite and the necessity of enhanced surveillance and control measures.']","['Dinkel, Kelcey D., [Herndon, David R.], [Noh, Susan M.], [Lahmers, Kevin K.], [Todd, S.

This systematic review revealed 42 prevalence studies, nine disease control articles and six articles on epidemiology. Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella inopinata and Brucella suis were reported in wildlife. The prevalence studies revealed serological evidence of brucellosis in buffalo, antelope (positive in 14/28 species), carnivores (4/12) and other species (7/20) over the last five decades. Buffalo populations were more likely to be infected and had a higher seroprevalence than other species; the pooled seroprevalence was 13.7% (95% CI 10.3–17.3%) in buffalo, 7.1% (95% CI 1.1–15.5%) in carnivores and 2.1% (95% CI 0.1–4.9%) in antelope. Wildlife in high rainfall areas (≥\u2009800\xa0mm) were more likely to be infected, and infected populations showed higher seroprevalence in high rainfall areas and in studies published after 2000.

"['Background Ticks are ectoparasites that feed on blood of a broad taxonomical range of terrestrial and flying vertebrates and are distributed across a wide range of environmental settings. To date, the species identity, diversity, and relationships among the ticks on lizards in China have been poorly understood. Methods In this study, 30 ticks, collected from the multi-ocellated racerunner ( Eremias multiocellata ) lizard in the Tarim Basin and adjacent Yanqi Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China, were identified by morphological observation and confirmed by DNA-based techniques. The mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA , 16S rRNA , and COI gene fragments of ticks were amplified and sequenced. To understand the genetic polymorphisms, 47 ticks collected from hedgehogs and 1 from brushwood in the Tarim Basin were also included. Species identification was based on both morphological and molecular characters. The median-joining network approach was used to evaluate the intraspecific genealogies of the ticks and their relatedness with the geographical origin or hosts. Results The sequence similarity analysis confirmed that the 30 ticks belong to three genera and three species including 11 individuals of Hyalomma asiaticum , 3 of Rhipicephalus turanicus , and 16 of Haemaphysalis sulcata . A network approach revealed paraphyletic populations of R. turanicus and Hy. asiaticum at the intraspecies level regarding geographical origin and low host specificity. For R. turanicus and Hy. asiaticum , common ancestry was observed between COI sequences from lizards and other sequence types from different hosts and countries. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study is the first to conduct a molecular survey of ticks from lizards in the arid regions of Xinjiang, China. Eremias multiocellata is an atypical host of the three tick species. Notably, two species of ticks, Hy. asiaticum and R. turanicus , have been collected and identified from lizards in China for the first time. Star-like networks suggest both of them might have experienced recent population expansion.

"[""Background Ticks (Arthropoda, Ixodida), after mosquitoes, are the second most prevalent vector of infectious diseases. They are responsible for spreading a multitude of pathogens and threatening the health and welfare of animals and human beings. However, given the history of tick-borne pathogen infections in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, surprisingly, neither the genetic diversity nor the spatial distribution of haplotypes within ticks has been studied. Methods We characterized the haplotype distribution of Dermacentor nuttalli in four main pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by sampling 109 individuals (recovered from sheep) in April–August 2019. The 16S rRNA gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the internal transcribed spacer 2 region (ITS2) were amplified and sequenced from extracted DNA. Results Twenty-six haplotypes were identified using 16S rRNA sequences, 57 haplotypes were identified with COI sequences, and 75 haplotypes were identified with ITS2 sequences. Among the three genes, total haplotype diversity was greater than 0.7, while total nucleotide diversity was greater than 0.06. Neutrality tests revealed a significantly negative Tajima’s D result, while Fu's Fs was not significantly positive. Fixation index values (F ST ) indicated that the degree of genetic differentiation among some sampled populations was small, while for others it was moderate. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the variation within populations was greater than that among populations. The mismatch analysis of D. nuttalli exhibited double peaks. Conclusion The genetic diversity of D. nuttalli populations in our region can likely adapt to different geographical environments, thereby leading to genetic diversity, and creating genetic differentiation among different populations. However, genetic differentiation is cryptic and does not form a pedigree geographical structure.""]","['Gui, Zheng, [Wu, Lin], [Cai, Hao], [Mu, Lan], [Yu, Jing-Feng], [Fu, Shao-Yin], [Si, Xiao-Yan]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04625-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04625-5'],[''],"['Genetic diversity analysis of Dermacentor nuttalli within Inner Mongolia, China']"

Most species are vectored by ticks (Ixodidae), with many zoonotic reservoir species among most terrestrial vertebrate groups.

"['More than 800 million people live in proximity to active volcanoes and could be directly impacted by potential eruptions. Mitigation of future volcanic hazards requires adequate warning of a pending eruption, which, in turn, requires detailed understanding of the fundamental processes driving volcanic activity. In this Review, we discuss the processes leading up to volcanic eruptions, by following the journey of magma from crustal storage zones to the surface. Magma reservoirs can feed volcanic eruptions if they contain sufficiently hot and mobile magma and are able to supply sufficient energy for the magma to reach the surface. Young volcanic plumbing systems favour volcanic activity, whereas storage becomes more likely in mature volcanic systems with large reservoirs (hundreds of cubic kilometres). Anticipating volcanic activity requires a multidisciplinary approach, as real-time monitoring and geophysical surveys must be combined with petrology and the eruptive history to understand the temporal evolution of volcanic systems over geological timescales. Numerical modelling serves to link different observational timescales, and the inversion of data sets with physics-based statistical approaches is a promising way forward to advance our understanding of the processes controlling recurrence rate and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. Anticipating the timing, style and size of volcanic eruptions is essential for hazard mitigation. This Review discusses the accumulation and evolution of magma storage regions, the processes that trigger magma reservoir failure and the ascent of magma through the crust. The thermal evolution of magmatic systems influences the physical properties of magma and the rocks surrounding the volcanic plumbing system, which, over the long term, favours magma storage over eruption. Magma recharge is the primary driver of magma reservoir pressurization and destabilization. Second boiling can trigger reservoir failure, although it is less likely to cause repeated eruptions. Only when volcanoes are in a critical state (close to eruption), small variations of stress or rock strength caused by external phenomena can help to initiate a volcanic eruption. Magma can become arrested on its way to the Earth’s surface because a lack of pressure or insufficient volume do not allow the magma to overcome stress barriers.']","['Caricchi, Luca, [Townsend, Meredith], [Rivalta, Eleonora], [Namiki, Atsuko]']",['10.1038/s43017-021-00174-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43017-021-00174-8'],[''],['The build-up and triggers of volcanic eruptions']
"['Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute viral zoonotic disease. The widespread geographic distribution of the disease and the increase in the incidence of the disease from new regions, placed CCHF in a list of public health emergency contexts. The rapid diagnosis, in rural and remote areas where the majority of cases occur, is essential for patient management. Aptamers are considered as a specific and sensitive tool for being used in rapid diagnostic methods. The Nucleoprotein (NP) of the CCHF virus (CCHFV) was selected as the target for the isolation of aptamers based on its abundance and conservative structure, among other viral proteins. A total of 120 aptamers were obtained through 9 rounds of SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) from the ssDNA aptamer library, including the random 40-nucleotide ssDNA region between primer binding sites (GCCTGTTGTGAGCCTCCTAAC(N 40 )GGGAGACAAGAATAAGCA). The K D of aptamers was calculated using the SPR technique. The Apt33 with the highest affinity to NP was selected to design the aptamer-antibody ELASA test. It successfully detected CCHF NP in the concentration of 90\xa0ng/ml in human serum. Evaluation of aptamer-antibody ELASA with clinical samples showed 100% specificity and sensitivity of the test. This simple, specific, and the sensitive assay can be used as a rapid and early diagnosis tool, as well as the use of this\xa0aptamer in\xa0point of care test\xa0near the patient.

"['Abstract Parasites, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists, helminths, and arthropods, are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Consequently, hosts are frequently infected with more than one parasite species simultaneously. The assessment of such co-infections is of fundamental importance for disease ecology, but relevant studies involving non-domesticated animals have remained scarce. Many amphibians are in decline, and they generally have a highly diverse parasitic fauna. Here we review the literature reporting on field surveys, veterinary case studies, and laboratory experiments on co-infections in amphibians, and we summarize what is known about within-host interactions among parasites, which environmental and intrinsic factors influence the outcomes of these interactions, and what effects co-infections have on hosts. The available literature is piecemeal, and patterns are highly diverse, so that identifying general trends that would fit most host–multiparasite systems in amphibians is difficult. Several examples of additive, antagonistic, neutral, and synergistic effects among different parasites are known, but whether members of some higher taxa usually outcompete and override the effects of others remains unclear. The arrival order of different parasites and the time lag between exposures appear in many cases to fundamentally shape competition and disease progression. The first parasite to arrive can gain a marked reproductive advantage or induce cross-reaction immunity, but by disrupting the skin and associated defences (i.e., skin secretions, skin microbiome) and by immunosuppression, it can also pave the way for subsequent infections. Although there are exceptions, detrimental effects to the host are generally aggravated with increasing numbers of co-infecting parasite species. Finally, because amphibians are ectothermic animals, temperature appears to be the most critical environmental factor that affects co-infections, partly via its influence on amphibian immune function, partly due to its direct effect on the survival and growth of parasites. Besides their importance for our understanding of ecological patterns and processes, detailed knowledge about co-infections is also crucial for the design and implementation of effective wildlife disease management, so that studies concentrating on the identified gaps in our understanding represent rewarding research avenues.

Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified.

"['Purpose of Review Travel medicine practitioners often are confronted with returning travelers with dermatologic disorders that could be of infectious causes or inflammatory or allergic. Some dermatologic processes are the result of exposure to insects or acquired due to environmental exposures. There is a broad range of dermatosis of infectious and non-infectious etiologies that clinicians need to consider in the differential diagnosis of dermatosis in travelers Recent Findings With increasing international travel to tropical destinations, many individuals may be exposed to rickettsia (i.e., African tick bite fever, scrub typhus, or Mediterranean spotted fever), parasitic infections (i.e., cutaneous larva migrans, cutaneous leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, or American trypanosomiasis), viral infections (i.e., measles or Zika virus infection), bacterial (i.e., Buruli ulcer) or ectoparasites (scabies or tungiasis), and myiasis. Cutaneous lesions provide clinical clues to the diagnosis of specific exposures during travel among returned travelers. Summary Dermatologic disorders represent the third most common health problem in returned travelers, after gastrointestinal and respiratory illness.

"['The Pampas region of central Argentina has undergone profound changes in land use during the last 2–3 decades. We studied the influences of land use and artificial water bodies on the habitat use of two semiaquatic rodents, coypus ( Myocastor coypus ) and capybaras ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ), in different ecological units of the Pampas. We sampled signs of activity of both species in a total of 231 transects (120 in spring, 111 in autumn) in 24 sites of the Flooding, Rolling and Inland Pampas. In each transect, we recorded the type of water body (artificial or natural) and the associated land use (crop or livestock). We modelled the probability of coypu/capybara presence at each site using generalized estimation equations. The probability of coypu’s occurrence in water bodies adjacent to livestock fields was lower during autumn (the season with low water availability) regardless of water body type. Moreover, coypus were positively associated with artificial water bodies and showed no differences among ecological units, which is consistent with its characterization as a frequent species in different types of aquatic habitats. Occurrence of capybaras was lower in water bodies adjacent to livestock fields and it differed among ecological units, evidencing the current expansion of its natural range. Our study suggests that the trend for increasing croplands in the Pampas Region, the displacement of livestock to wetland areas, and the creation of artificial water bodies affect the patterns of habitat use of coypu and capybara. For capybara, we report the colonization of new areas of the Inland Pampas, increasing its western range.']","['Corriale, Maria Jose, [Pedelacq, Maria Eugenia], [Guichón, María Laura], [Bilenca, David Norberto]']",['10.1007/s42991-020-00082-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42991-020-00082-2'],[''],['Influence of land use and artificial water bodies on the habitat use of Myocastor coypus and Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris in the Argentine Pampas']
"['The COVID-19 epidemic created, at the time of writing the paper, highly unusual and uncertain socio-economic conditions. The world economy was severely impacted and business-as-usual activities severely disrupted. The situation presented the necessity to make a trade-off between individual health and safety on one hand and socio-economic progress on the other. Based on the current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a broad set of control measures has emerged along dimensions such as restricting people’s movements, high-volume testing, contract tracing, use of face masks, and enforcement of social-distancing. However, these interventions have their own limitations and varying level of efficacy depending on factors such as the population density and the socio-economic characteristics of the area. To help tailor the intervention, we develop a configurable, fine-grained agent-based simulation model that serves as a virtual representation, i.e., a digital twin of a diverse and heterogeneous area such as a city. In this paper, to illustrate our techniques, we focus our attention on the Indian city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra. We use the digital twin to simulate various what-if scenarios of interest to (1) predict the spread of the virus; (2) understand the effectiveness of candidate interventions; and (3) predict the consequences of introduction of interventions possibly leading to trade-offs between public health, citizen comfort, and economy. Our model is configured for the specific city of interest and used as an in-silico experimentation aid to predict the trajectory of active infections, mortality rate, load on hospital, and quarantine facility centers for the candidate interventions. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel agent-based model that seamlessly captures people, place, and movement characteristics of the city, COVID-19 virus characteristics, and primitive set of candidate interventions, and (2) a simulation-driven approach to determine the exact intervention that needs to be applied under a given set of circumstances.

"['Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is one of the most important viral diseases around the world. Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) and maize rough dwarf virus (MRDV) cause MRDD in East Asia and Mediterranean regions, respectively. RBSDV and MRDV are similar in many features such as host range, disease symptoms, vector, and serological relationships, which make it hard to differentiate them based on serological and biological properties. However, molecular analyses as powerful tools could be used for differentiating species of fijiviruses. In this study, the complete genome sequence, genetic variation of 13 isolates using the nucleotide sequence of segment 10 ORF, and host range of MRDD causal agent in Iran were determined. Whole-genome comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that Iranian isolate shared high nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 86.5–91.3% and closest evolutionary relationship to the RBSDV Chinese isolates. The Iranian isolates showed over 99% homology based on amino acid sequence of ORF10 and were grouped in one clade through phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed that ORF10 of MRDD causal agent was under negative selection. Iranian isolate of MRDD was experimentally transmitted to maize, rice, barley, wheat, millet, oat, rye, and some grasses by Loadelphax striatellus with about 32% efficiency.

"['Background Wolbachia is an obligate intracellular maternally transmitted, gram-negative bacterium which forms a spectrum of endosymbiotic relationships from parasitism to obligatory mutualism in a wide range of arthropods and onchocercid nematodes, respectively. In arthropods Wolbachia produces reproductive manipulations such as male killing, feminization, parthenogenesis and cytoplasmic incompatibility for its propagation and provides an additional fitness benefit for the host to protect against pathogens, whilst in onchocercid nematodes, apart from the mutual metabolic dependence, this bacterium is involved in moulting, embryogenesis, growth and survival of the host. Methods This review details the molecular data of Wolbachia and its effect on host biology, immunity, ecology and evolution, reproduction, endosymbiont-based treatment and control strategies exploited for filariasis.

With a death toll surpassing 500,000 in the United States alone, containing the pandemic is predicated on achieving herd immunity on a global scale. This implies that at least 70-80\u2009% of the population must achieve active immunity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), either as a result of a previous COVID-19 infection or by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In December 2020, the first two vaccines were approved by the FDA through emergency use authorization in the United States. These vaccines are based on the mRNA vaccine platform and were developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Published safety and efficacy trials reported high efficacy rates of 94-95\u2009% after two interval doses, in conjunction with limited side effects and a low rate of adverse reactions. The rapid pace of vaccine development and the uncertainty of potential long-term adverse effects raised some level of hesitation against mRNA vaccines in the global community. A successful vaccination campaign is contingent on widespread access to the vaccine under appropriate storage conditions, deployment of a sufficient number of vaccinators, and the willingness of the population to be vaccinated.

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities.

Control of these flies has been limited to increased sanitary management practices and insecticide application for suppressing larval stages. Few genetic and molecular resources are available to help in developing novel methods for controlling stable flies. Results This study examines stable fly biology by utilizing a combination of high-quality genome sequencing and RNA-Seq analyses targeting multiple developmental stages and tissues. In conjunction, 1600 genes were manually curated to characterize genetic features related to stable fly reproduction, vector host interactions, host-microbe dynamics, and putative targets for control. Most notable was characterization of genes associated with reproduction and identification of expanded gene families with functional associations to vision, chemosensation, immunity, and metabolic detoxification pathways. Conclusions The combined sequencing, assembly, and curation of the male stable fly genome followed by RNA-Seq and downstream analyses provide insights necessary to understand the biology of this important pest.

"['The importance of vectors and vector-borne diseases (VBDs) is increasing on a global scale.

However, these animals are known to migrate to lower regions in the winter season, and therefore, it is of interest to investigate if VBPs are also present in mammals faithful to their higher altitude alpine habitat all year round. Blood parasites and other VBPs, namely.

It has been reported mostly from North America, several Scandinavian countries, and certain Asian countries. The disease spreads through vectors such as mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flies, and ticks. Humans can acquire the disease through direct contact of sick animals, consumption of infected animals, drinking or direct contact of contaminated water, and inhalation of bacteria-loaded aerosols. Low infectious dose, aerosol route of infection, and its ability to induce fatal disease make it a potential agent of biological warfare. Tularemia leads to several clinical forms, such as glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. The disease is diagnosed through the use of culture, serology, or molecular methods. Quinolones, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides are frequently used in the treatment of tularemia.

Some fungi are capable of infecting and killing insects and, hence, are commonly known as entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). On the other hand, some insects can kill harmful fungal strains using their products such as peptides. Hence, the aim of this review article is to highlight the use of EPF as biocontrol tools against each other. Results EPF are generally characterized by having a wide range of hosts which made them the perfect candidate for biological control missions. They are existing in abundance in the environment and involved in plenty of environmental interactions. They have prestigious enzymatic machinery and toxins that contribute as killing tools. Moreover, after penetrating the insect, the expanded vegetative growth of hyphal bodies enabling the invasion of the fungi throughout the entire tissues of host insect cause physic, histolytic, and pathologic changes ultimately leading to the death of the host insect. On the other hand, some insects can kill harmful fungal strains using their secreted products such as peptides. Conclusion In this review, the use of fungi and insects as biological control agents against each other was described. Furthermore, the history of using EPF for this purpose, their killing mechanism, host range, and the factors affecting EPF virulence were highlighted. Moreover, the role of insect’s immunology and some insect’s products as antifungal agents was presented focusing on peptides with biological activities against fungi.

The larger challenge than managing any disease in livestock, then, is controlling it in free-ranging wildlife. Farm typologies in North America vary from small subsistence producers with little biosecurity to immense, industrialized operations that employ high levels of biosecurity. Of course, with all the feed and waste associated with these large operations, many species of wildlife are continually attracted to them and challenging strategies put in place to limit pathogen transmission.

Arboviral infections could also affect the host’s nutritional status.

Pediatric obesity may be related to increased risk of adverse dengue-related outcomes, although most available evidence is from observational studies subject to bias. Low circulating concentrations of nutrient biomarkers, including specific fatty acids and amino acids, vitamin D, and some minerals have been related to increased severity of dengue disease, but it is possible that these associations reflect the effect of disease on the biomarkers.

"['Viruses in the family Reoviridae can infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, bacteria, and plants. They form a diverse group, harboring particular 9–12 segmented double-stranded RNA genomes contained within icosahedral, nonenveloped, multilayered protein capsids. Aquareovirus, a recently classified member of the Reoviridae family, has been isolated from aquatic animals of freshwater and saline water origins worldwide. Generally, aquareoviruses exert low pathogenicity in their natural hosts. However, some isolates are highly virulent in cultured fish species. Aquareovirus particles physically resemble orthoreoviruses, and the enclosed 11-segmented genome is similar to that of rotaviruses; however, no antigenic relationship has been detected. An increasing number of genome sequence- and particle structure-based evolutionary analyses suggest that the genus Aquareovirus shares a sister-like relationship with members of the genus Orthoreovirus . This new molecular evidence indicates that the peculiar endogenous transcription and cell penetration-related characteristics are attributed to uniformly conserved protein and functional domains encoded by the genome segments 1–6 (S1–S6) of aquareoviruses. In contrast, proteins encoded by smaller class gene segments (S7–S11) that are involved in cell-receptor attachment and replication-related events are largely divergent. Therefore, our current understanding of aquareovirus infection and pathogenesis provides significant insights into the fundamental mechanisms involved in the molecular evolution of the 11 genomic segments and, in general, functions of the encoded proteins, thereby leading to the development of better prevention and control strategies for diseases caused by aquareovirus infection.']","['Fang, Qin, [Zhang, Jie], [Zhang, Fuxian]']",['10.1007/978-981-16-1903-8_1'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-1903-8_1'],[''],['Aquareovirus: An Overview']

"['Humans have basic needs to satisfy, which are widely expressed as adequate food, shelter, clothing, education, clean water and air, sanitation, and good health, among others. These universal physiological needs are at the core of the material aspect of human security. Meeting these needs is a requisite for survival and essential for human well-being. Human insecurity occurs when these basic needs are not met. Failure to satisfy them is unjust and a serious denial of basic human rights and security. Recent literature points out that unsatisfied basic needs may not solely be attributed to poverty and lack of access to basic services but also to pressing environmental factors such as climate change impacts and disaster risks. This chapter contends that the provision of basic needs, which forms the very core of human security, will be progressively threatened in many parts of Asia as climate changes and disaster risks escalate. It further argues that climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies have been employed by many Asian countries, although there is yet no comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness in satisfying the human basic needs and security of the poor and vulnerable sector. The chapter concludes that it is crucial to mainstream CCA and DRR in national and local development agenda particularly in the less economically developed and more vulnerable countries in Asia, with the end view of protecting the basic needs and security of the poor in the context of changing climate and increasing incidence of disasters.']","['Sabino, Lorena L., [Pulhin, Juan M.]']",['10.1007/978-981-15-8852-5_5'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-8852-5_5'],[''],['Satisfying the Basic Needs: The Material Aspect of Human Security']

"['Affliction of the afferent visual system, in particular acute optic neuritis (AON), is commonly seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory autoimmune conditions. AON is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve. The clinical presentation of AON is variable, though most commonly involves pain and impairment or loss of vision in the affected eye. Severity, duration, and resolution of symptoms depend on underlying disease pathology. In the Western world, AON is most commonly seen in the setting of demyelinating conditions such as MS. The spectrum of conditions associated with AON, however, is broad and includes non-MS autoimmune and demyelinating diseases, infections, granulomatous disease, paraneoplastic processes, and rarely, hereditary diseases. Identifying potential “red-flags” or atypical features of AON is important in the consideration of alternative diagnoses to MS as the underlying mechanism. While diagnosis of AON is primarily clinical, utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological studies has historically aided AON diagnosis. Utilization of more advanced imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), has allowed for more specific analyses and monitoring of axonal and neuronal degeneration following AON. The treatment of classic demyelinating, including idiopathic, forms of AON has primarily focused on the use of corticosteroids, although this approach may not actually be supported by evidence.

"['Immune-mediated neuropathies constitute acute and chronic disorders, the prototypes of which are Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory/immune demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), respectively. The most common variants of GBS are acute inflammatory/immune demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), but less common variants exist. Cell-mediated and antibody-mediated mechanisms are suspected in the pathophysiology of GBS, which is often precipitated by an antecedent event. GBS is characterized by symmetric weakness, areflexia, sensory symptoms, and frequent autonomic features. The clinical course is monophasic with spontaneous recovery, but residual deficits are common. Immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PLEX) hastens recovery and likely improves clinical outcomes. CIDP also has several variants and is often regarded as the chronic counterpart to GBS. As with GBS, the pathophysiology of this disorder has yet to be fully characterized, and both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated mechanisms are thought to be instrumental. Accurate diagnosis is paramount and necessitates evidence of a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy. Several important mimics of CIDP are demyelinating hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN); IgM-associated neuropathy; and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome. The first-line maintenance therapies for CIDP are corticosteroids and IVIg; however, there is growing evidence that rituximab has a role in certain subpopulations of CIDP.

"['Marine protected areas (MPAs) play a leading role in conserving and restoring marine environments. MPAs can benefit both marine populations within their boundaries and external populations owing to a net export of organisms (spillover). However, little is known about variation in performance within MPAs. For example, edge effects may degrade populations within MPAs close to their boundaries. Here we synthesize empirical estimates of 72 taxa of fish and invertebrates to explore spatial patterns across the borders of 27 no-take MPAs. We show that there is a prominent and consistent edge effect that extends approximately 1\u2009km within the MPA, in which population sizes on the border are 60% smaller than those in the core area. Our analysis of cross-boundary population trends suggests that, globally, the smallest 64% of no-take MPAs (those of less than 10\u2009km 2 in area) may hold only about half (45–56%) of the population size that is implied by their area. MPAs with buffer zones did not display edge effects, suggesting that extending no-take areas beyond the target habitats and managing fishing activities around MPA borders are critical for boosting MPA performance.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens.

"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks.

"['Cheliceral chelal design in free-living astigmatid mites (Arthropoda: Acari) is reviewed within a mechanical model. Trophic access (body size and cheliceral reach) and food morsel handling (chelal gape and estimated static adductive crushing force) are morphologically investigated. Forty-seven commonly occurring astigmatid mite species from 20 genera (covering the Acaridae, Aeroglyphidae, Carpoglyphidae, Chortoglyphidae, Glycyphagidae, Lardoglyphidae, Pyroglyphidae, Suidasiidae, and Winterschmidtiidae) are categorised into functional groups using heuristics. Conclusions are confirmed with statistical tests and multivariate morphometrics. Despite these saprophagous acarines in general being simple ‘shrunken/swollen’ versions of each other, clear statistical correlations in the specifics of their mechanical design (cheliceral and chelal scale and general shape) with the type of habitat and food consumed (their ‘biome’) are found. Using multivariate analyses, macro- and microsaprophagous subtypes are delineated. Relative ratios of sizes on their own are not highly informative of adaptive syndromes. Sympatric resource competition is examined. Evidence for a maximum doubling of approximate body volume within nominal taxa is detected but larger mites are not more ‘generalist’ feeding types. Two contrasting types of basic ‘Bauplan’ are found differing in general scale: (i) a large, chunk-crunching, ‘demolition’-feeding omnivore design (comprising 10 macrosaprophagous astigmatid species), and (ii) a small selective picking, squashing/slicing or fragmentary/‘plankton’ feeding design (which may indicate obligate fungivory/microbivory) comprising 20 microsaprophagous acarid-shaped species. Seventeen other species appear to be specialists. Eleven of these are either: small (interstitial/burrowing) omnivores—or a derived form designed for processing large hard food morsels (debris durophagy, typified by the pyroglyphid Dermatophagoides farinae ), or a specialist sub-type of particular surface gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeding. Six possible other minor specialist gleaning/scraping fragmentary feeders types each comprising one to two species are described. Details of these astigmatid trophic-processing functional groups need field validation and more corroborative comparative enzymology. Chelal velocity ratio in itself is not highly predictive of habitat but with cheliceral aspect ratio (or chelal adductive force) is indicative of life-style. Herbivores and pest species are typified by a predicted large chelal adductive force. Pest species may be ‘shredders’ derived from protein-seeking necrophages. Carpoglyphus lactis typifies a mite with tweezer-like chelae of very feeble adductive force. It is suggested that possible zoophagy (hypocarnivory) is associated with low chelal adductive force together with a small or large gape depending upon the size of the nematode being consumed. Kuzinia laevis typifies an oophagous durophage. Functional form is correlated with taxonomic position within the Astigmata—pyroglyphids and glycyphagids being distinct from acarids. A synthesis with mesostigmatid and oribatid feeding types is offered together with clarification of terminologies. The chelal lyrifissure in the daintiest chelicerae of these astigmatids is located similar to where the action of the chelal moveable digit folds the cheliceral shaft in uropodoids, suggesting mechanical similarities of function. Acarid astigmatids are trophically structured like microphytophagous/fragmentary feeding oribatids. Some larger astigmatids ( Aleuroglyphus ovatus , Kuzinia laevis , Tyroborus lini ) approximate, and Neosuidasia sp. matches, the design of macrophytophagous oribatids. Most astigmatid species reviewed appear to be positioned with other oribatid secondary decomposers. Only Dermatophagoides microceras might be a primary decomposer approximating a lichenivorous oribatid ( Austrachipteria sp.) in trophic form. Astigmatid differences are consilient with the morphological trend from micro- to macrophytophagy in oribatids. The key competency in these actinotrichid mites is a type of ‘gnathosomisation’ through increased chelal and cheliceral height (i.e., a shape change that adjusts the chelal input effort arm and input adductive force) unrestricted by the dorsal constraint of a mesostigmatid-like gnathotectum. A predictive nomogram for ecologists to use on field samples is included.

Discussion This review evaluates the diagnosis, management, and empiric treatment of suspected CM in the ED. CM can easily evade diagnosis with a subacute presentation, and should be considered in any patient with a headache, neurological deficit, or who is immunocompromised. As a definitive diagnosis of CM will not be made in the ED, management of a patient with suspected CM includes prompt diagnostic testing and initiation of empiric treatment. Multiple types of newer Cryptococcal antigen tests provide high sensitivity and specificity both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients should be treated empirically for bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis, specifically with amphotericin B and flucytosine for presumed CM. Additionally, appropriate resuscitation and supportive care, including advanced airway management, management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), antipyretics, intravenous fluids, and isolation, should be initiated. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be initiated in the ED for those found or known to be HIV-positive for risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Conclusions CM remains a rare clinical presentation, but carries significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these patients while evaluating for other diseases and complications. Early consultation with an infectious disease specialist is imperative, as is initiating symptomatic care.']","['Fisher, Kathryn Marie, [Montrief, Tim], [Ramzy, Mark], [Koyfman, Alex], [Long, Brit]']",['10.1007/s11739-020-02619-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02619-2'],[''],['Cryptococcal meningitis: a review for emergency clinicians']
"['Background Biogeochemical exports from watersheds are modulated by the activity of microorganisms that function over micron scales. Here, we tested the hypothesis that meander-bound regions share a core microbiome and exhibit patterns of metabolic potential that broadly predict biogeochemical processes in floodplain soils along a river corridor. Results We intensively sampled the microbiomes of floodplain soils located in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the East River, Colorado. Despite the very high microbial diversity and complexity of the soils, we reconstructed 248 quality draft genomes representative of subspecies. Approximately one third of these bacterial subspecies was detected across all three locations at similar abundance levels, and ~ 15% of species were detected in two consecutive years. Within the meander-bound floodplains, we did not detect systematic patterns of gene abundance based on sampling position relative to the river. However, across meanders, we identified a core floodplain microbiome that is enriched in capacities for aerobic respiration, aerobic CO oxidation, and thiosulfate oxidation with the formation of elemental sulfur. Given this, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of the middle floodplain. In contrast to predictions made based on the prominence of gene inventories, the most highly transcribed genes were relatively rare amoCAB and nxrAB (for nitrification) genes, followed by genes involved in methanol and formate oxidation, and nitrogen and CO 2 fixation. Within all three meanders, low soil organic carbon correlated with high activity of genes involved in methanol, formate, sulfide, hydrogen, and ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidoreduction, and nitrate and nitrite reduction. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of sulfur, one-carbon and nitrogen compound metabolism in soils of the riparian corridor. Conclusions The disparity between the scale of a microbial cell and the scale of a watershed currently limits the development of genomically informed predictive models describing watershed biogeochemical function. Meander-bound floodplains appear to serve as scaling motifs that predict aggregate capacities for biogeochemical transformations, providing a foundation for incorporating riparian soil microbiomes in watershed models. Widely represented genetic capacities did not predict in situ activity at one time point, but rather they define a reservoir of biogeochemical potential available as conditions change.

"[""A model based upon mechanics is used in a re-analysis of historical acarine morphological work augmented by an extra seven zoophagous mesostigmatid species. This review shows that predatory mesostigmatids do have cheliceral designs with clear rational purposes. Almost invariably within an overall body size class, the switch in predatory style from a worm-like prey feeding (‘crushing/mashing’ kill) functional group to a micro-arthropod feeding (‘active prey cutting/slicing/slashing' kill) functional group is matched by: an increased cheliceral reach, a bigger chelal gape, a larger morphologically estimated chelal crunch force, and a drop in the adductive lever arm velocity ratio of the chela. Small size matters. Several uropodines ( Eviphis ostrinus , the omnivore Trachytes aegrota , Urodiaspis tecta and, Uropoda orbicularis ) have more elongate chelicerae (greater reach) than their chelal gape would suggest, even allowing for allometry across mesostigmatids. They may be: plesiosaur-like high-speed strikers of prey, scavenging carrion feeders (like long-necked vultures), probing/burrowing crevice feeders of cryptic nematodes, or small morsel/fragmentary food feeders. Some uropodoids have chelicerae and chelae which probably work like a construction-site mechanical excavator-digger with its small bucket. Possible hoeing/bulldozing, spore-cracking and tiny sabre-tooth cat-like striking actions are discussed for others. Subtle changes lead small mesostigmatids to be predator–scavengers (mesocarnivores) or to be predator–fungivores (hypocarnivores). Some uropodines (e.g., the worm-like prey feeder Alliphis siculus and, Uropoda orbicularis ) show chelae similar in design to astigmatids and cryptostigmatids indicating possible facultative saprophagy. Scale matters—obligate predatory designs (hypercarnivory) start for mesostigmatids with chelal gape > 150 μm and cheliceral reach > 350 μm (i.e., about 500–650 μm in body size). Commonality of trophic design in these larger species with solifugids is indicated. Veigaia species with low chelal velocity ratio and other morphological strengthening specialisms, appear specially adapted in a concerted way for predating active soft and fast moving springtails (Collembola). Veigaia cerva shows a markedly bigger chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would proportionately infer suggesting it is a crocodile-like sit-and-wait or ambush predator par excellence . A small chelal gape, low cheliceral reach, moderate velocity ratio variant of the worm-like feeding habit design is supported for phytoseiid pollenophagy. Evidence for a resource partitioning model in the evolution of gnathosomal development is found. A comparison to crustacean claws and vertebrate mandibles is made. Alliphis siculus and Rhodacarus strenzkei are surprisingly powerful mega-cephalics for their small size. Parasitids show a canid-like trophic design. The chelicera of the nematophagous Alliphis halleri shows felid-like features. Glyphtholaspis confusa has hyaena-like cheliceral dentition. The latter species has a markedly smaller chelal gape than its cheliceral reach would suggest proportionately, which together with a high chelal velocity ratio and a high estimated chelal crunch force matches a power specialism of feeding on immobile tough fly eggs/pupae by crushing (durophagy). A consideration of gnathosomal orientation is made. Predatory specialisms appear to often match genera especially in larger mesostigmatids, which may scale quite differently. Comparison to holothyrids and opilioacarids indicates that the cheliceral chelae of the former are cutting-style and those of the latter are crushing-style. A simple validated easy-to-use ‘2:1 on’ predictive algorithm of feeding habit type is included based on a strength-speed tradeoff in chelal velocity ratio for ecologists to test in the field.""]","['Bowman, Clive E.']",['10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00612-8'],[''],['Feeding design in free-living mesostigmatid chelicerae (Acari: Anactinotrichida)']
"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Background Our study was designed to reveal a detailed forest fire history at Catoctin Mountain Park, Maryland, USA. We compared the ages of living trees to known fire dates in the dendrochronological record. Seasonality and years of fires in the dendrochronological record were juxtaposed with specific dates of fires recorded in newspapers. Results Twenty-seven pines ( Pinus L . ) captured 122 fire scars representing 58 distinct fire years between 1702 and 1951. Climate was significantly hotter and drier in the years of burns that affected at least two trees and was wetter two years prior. Thirty-three fires described in local newspapers were reported largely in the spring and fall months (68% between March and June, 32% between September and December). Ninety-one percent of fire scars in our tree-ring chronology had dormant seasonality. The mean fire interval was 5.47 ± 10.14 (SD; standard deviation) yr, and the Weibull median fire interval was 3.22 yr during the entire chronology. The longest fire-free interval was from 1952 to 2018. The size structure of living trees was biased toward smaller black gums ( Nyssa sylvatica Marshall) and oaks ( Quercus L.) that recruited in the 1930s and 1940s. Most living pitch pines ( Pinus rigida Mill) recruited between 1890 and 1910, but a few individuals recruited before the 1850s. Diversity of tree stems smaller than 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) was generally lacking; the youngest tree >10 cm DBH in our study area had recruited by 1967. Conclusions The Catoctin Mountains experienced frequent fire during the 1800s and early 1900s. The causes of fires were diverse, including accidental ignitions and purposeful cultural burning for berry ( Vaccinium L.) production. The current forest developed during a period of low deer density and after the demise of the charcoal iron industry ended an era of logging. The lack of fire since the 1950s has encouraged the development of a black gum dominated mid- and understory. Management with frequent fire would facilitate pine and oak regeneration. Antecedentes Nuestro trabajo fue diseñado para exponer una detallada historia del fuego en el Parque de las Montañas Catoctin, en Maryland, EEUU. Comparamos las edades de árboles vivos con fechas de fuegos conocidas a través del registro dendrocronológico. La estacionalidad y años de incendios tomados del registro dendrocronológico fueron yuxtapuestos con datos específicos de incendios registrados por los periódicos locales. Resultados Veintisiete pinos ( Pinus L . ) registraron 122 cicatrices de fuegos, representado 58 años diferentes de ocurrencia de incendios desde 1702 hasta 1951. El clima fue significativamente más cálido y seco en los años de fuego en que fueron afectados al menos dos árboles, y que su vez los dos años previos al incendio fueron más húmedos. Treinta y tres incendios descriptos en diarios locales fueron reportados mayoritariamente durante los meses de primavera y otoño (68% entre marzo y junio, 32% entre septiembre y diciembre). Noventa y uno por ciento de las cicatrices de fuego en nuestra cronología de recuento de anillos tuvieron dormancia estacional. El intervalo medio entre fuegos fue de 5,47\xa0±\xa010,14\xa0años, (SD; desviación estándar)\xa0y la mediana de Weibull de intervalo entre fuegos fue de 3,22\xa0años durante toda la cronología. El intervalo más alto de períodos sin fuegos fue de 1952 a 2018. El tamaño de la estructura de los árboles vivos estuvo sesgado hacia pequeños tupelos ( Nyssa sylvatica Marshall) y robles ( Quercus L.) reclutados entre los años 1930 y 1940s. La mayoría de los árboles vivos del pino bronco ( Pinus rigida Mill) se reclutaron entre 1890 y 1910, y muy pocos individuos fueron reclutados antes de 1850s. La diversidad de tallos de árboles menores a 10\xa0cm de diámetro a la altura del pecho (DAP) estuvo generalmente ausente; el árbol más joven con DAP >10\xa0cm en nuestra área de estudio fue reclutado en 1967. Conclusiones Las Montañas Catoctin experimentaron fuegos frecuentes durante los años 1800 y principios de 1900s. Las causas de los incendios fueron diversas, incluyendo igniciones accidentales e intencionales con el propósito cultural de promover la producción de arándanos ( Vaccinium L.). El bosque actual se desarrolló durante el período de baja densidad de ciervos y después de que la industria del hierro cesara el uso carbón de leña, lo que finalizó con una era de tala de esos bosques. La falta de fuegos desde los años 1950s ha promovido el desarrollo del tupelo en el dosel medio y bajo. El manejo con fuegos más frecuentes podría facilitar la regeneración de pinos y robles.']","['Howard, Lauren F., [Cahalan, Gabriel D.], [Ehleben, Kristyn], [Muhammad El, Baaqeyah Amala], [Halza, Hope], [DeLeon, Stephen]']",['10.1186/s42408-021-00096-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42408-021-00096-2'],[''],"['Fire history and dendroecology of Catoctin Mountain, Maryland, USA, with newspaper corroboration']"

Results We estimated the prevalence and diversity of avian Haemosporidia across 24 bird species, detecting 39 parasite haplotypes. We found that open-cup nesters have higher Haemoproteus prevalence than cavity or ground nesters. Additionally, we found that male Ruby-crowned Kinglets, White-crowned Sparrows, and Wilson’s Warblers have higher Haemoproteus prevalence compared to other host species.

"['Abstract Ecological regularities of the Urup Island landscape differentiation of avifauna and bird population are analyzed. The data were obtained in a 2019 expedition during a survey of the southern part of the Great Kuril ridge. The research was conducted in the vicinity of Novokurilskaya Bay in the northeast of Urup Island and in the vicinity of Shchukin Bay on the Van der Lind Peninsula in the southwest of the island by route accounting on transects of unlimited width at altitudes of 0–200 m above sea level. The commonality of the taxonomic structure and species composition of the avifauna on Urup Island is high; in 2019, 90 bird species were recorded there: 59 on the northeast and 56 on the southwest of the island. The similarity coefficient of local avifauna of the surveyed points ( n = 2), which was obtained by the Sørensen formula, is 68%. In all, 38% of species are widespread, 41% are local, and 21% are in isolated foci. Six species were recorded on Urup Island for the first time. The taxonomic structure of the Urup avifauna, formed by species of 12 orders, corresponds to the zonal and landscape features of island territories located near northeastern Eurasia. Passeriformes (39%), Charadriiformes (28%), and Anseriformes (10%), which are characteristic of the Boreal and Hypo-Arctic zones of the Palearctic, dominate. The zoogeographic originality of the local avifauna is due to the combination of elements of the Far Eastern–island, Pacifical, Siberian, and Chinese faunal complexes; Siberian–American and widespread species; and Japanese island endemics. The avifauna of Urup Island is formed in the system of general zonal-landscape and altitude-belt patterns combining ecological groups of marine, land, and mountain species. Mountain specifics of the avifauna are defined by the species ( n = 9), which are ecologically closely related to land or water–near-water elements of the alpine landscape over the entire area of their range or a significant part of it. The bird population density of land habitats is 323‒609 sp/km 2 (on average 466 sp/km 2 ); on the coast and nearby sea area, it is 774–2050 sp/km 2 (on average 1412 sp/km 2 ). The similarity coefficients of bird populations are 20% in land-based habitats and 17% in the coastal-marine habitats. The population of forest and bush habitats is dominated by the Pacific swift, buff-bellied pipit, Arctic warbler, Eurasian nutcracker, and gray bunting. The population in the coast and the adjacent sea area is dominated by the harlequin duck, glaucous-winged gull, black-legged kittiwake, Pacific swift, buff-bellied pipit, and black-backed (White) wagtail. In open sea areas, the most common species are the black-footed albatross and Laysan albatross, northern fulmar, short-tailed shearwater, common murre, and tufted puffin.']","['Romanov, A.

"['Background Spotted fever group rickettsiae represent one of the most diverse groups of vector-borne bacteria, with several human pathogenic species showing an emerging trend worldwide. Most species are vectored by ticks (Ixodidae), with many zoonotic reservoir species among most terrestrial vertebrate groups. While the reservoir competence of many different vertebrate species is well known (e.g. birds, rodents and dogs), studies on insectivorous bats have been rarely performed despite their high species diversity, ubiquitous urban presence and importance in harboring zoonotic disease agents. Romania has a high diversity and ubiquity of bats. Moreover, seven out of eight SFG rickettsiae species with zoonotic potential were previously reported in Romania. Based on this, the aim of this study was to detect Rickettsia species in tissue samples in bats. Methods Here we report a large-scale study (322 bats belonging to 20 species) on the presence of Rickettsia spp. in Romanian bat species. Tissue samples from insectivorous bats were tested for the presence of Rickettsia DNA using PCR detection amplifying a 381 bp fragment of the gltA gene. Positive results were sequenced to confirm the results. The obtained results were statistically analyzed by chi-squared independence test. Results Positive results were obtained in 14.6% of bat samples. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of R. monacensis in two bat species ( Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) in two locations.

"['Tularemia is a bacterial disease of humans, wild, and domestic animals. Francisella tularensis , which is a Gram-negative coccobacillus-shaped bacterium, is the causative agent of tularemia. Recently, an increase in the number of human tularemia cases has been noticed in several countries around the world. It has been reported mostly from North America, several Scandinavian countries, and certain Asian countries. The disease spreads through vectors such as mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flies, and ticks. Humans can acquire the disease through direct contact of sick animals, consumption of infected animals, drinking or direct contact of contaminated water, and inhalation of bacteria-loaded aerosols. Low infectious dose, aerosol route of infection, and its ability to induce fatal disease make it a potential agent of biological warfare. Tularemia leads to several clinical forms, such as glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. The disease is diagnosed through the use of culture, serology, or molecular methods. Quinolones, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides are frequently used in the treatment of tularemia. No licensed vaccine is available in the prophylaxis of tularemia and this is need of the time and high-priority research area.

In Plato’s Phaedrus , a plane tree is not only a site for philosophical discourse but also a figure for the transformative power of writing as pharmakon . Centuries later, the Christian writer Methodius pens his Symposium , a Platonizing dialogue that borrows its setting from the Phaedrus , while shifting its focus from Plato’s plane tree to the chaste tree by its side. For the virgins who gather in its shade, the chaste tree becomes a powerful mediator of ascetic transformation, drawing on its known pharmacological powers as well as its biblical efficacy. Also referencing Plato implicitly, the Cappadocian theologian Gregory of Nazianzus returns to the plane tree in his correspondence with his friend Basil. There it becomes part of a larger discussion of the proper setting and aims of ascetic life among philosophically inclined Christian men. Gregory’s evocation of Basil sitting under the plane tree echoes another solitary figure under a tree—namely, the biblical Jonah, as he appears so frequently in ancient Christian art, languishing under a gourd tree. Augustine’s defense of the gourd in his debate with Jerome about biblical translation makes it clear that the biblical tree, far from being a mere background figure, is an object of abiding and transformative love.']","['Arentzen, Thomas, [Burrus, Virginia], [Peers, Glenn]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-75902-5_2'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75902-5_2'],[''],['Writing on Trees']

"['Regulatory factors controlling tick salivary glands (SGs) are direct upstream neural signaling pathways arising from the tick’s central nervous system. Here we investigated the cholinergic signaling pathway in the SG of two hard tick species.

Immunohistochemical staining revealed that cholinergic axonal projections exclusively reached type I acini in the SG of both Ixodes species.

"['Background Pathogenic Rickettsia species belonging to the spotted fever group are arthropod-borne, obligate intracellular bacteria which exhibit preferential tropism for host microvascular endothelium in the mammalian hosts, resulting in disease manifestations attributed primarily to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Although rickettsiae are known to undergo evolution through genomic reduction, the mechanisms by which these pathogens regulate their transcriptome to ensure survival in tick vectors and maintenance by transovarial/transstadial transmission, in contrast to their ability to cause debilitating infections in human hosts remain unknown. In this study, we compare the expression profiles of rickettsial sRNAome/transcriptome and determine the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of R. conorii transcripts during in vitro infection of human and tick host cells. Results We performed deep sequencing on total RNA from Amblyomma americanum AAE2 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) infected with R. conorii . Strand-specific RNA sequencing of R. conorii transcripts revealed the expression 32 small RNAs ( Rc _sR’s), which were preferentially expressed above the limit of detection during tick cell infection, and confirmed the expression of Rc _sR61, sR71, and sR74 by quantitative RT-PCR. Intriguingly, a total of 305 and 132 R. conorii coding genes were differentially upregulated (>\u20092-fold) in AAE2 cells and HMECs, respectively. Further, enrichment for primary transcripts by treatment with Terminator 5′-Phosphate-dependent Exonuclease resulted in the identification of 3903 and 2555 transcription start sites (TSSs), including 214 and 181 primary TSSs in R. conorii during the infection to tick and human host cells, respectively. Seventy-five coding genes exhibited different TSSs depending on the host environment. Finally, we also observed differential expression of 6S RNA during host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interactions in vitro, implicating an important role for this noncoding RNA in the regulation of rickettsial transcriptome depending on the supportive host niche. Conclusions In sum, the findings of this study authenticate the presence of novel Rc _sR’s in R. conorii, reveal the first evidence for differential expression of coding transcripts and utilization of alternate transcriptional start sites depending on the host niche, and implicate a role for 6S RNA in the regulation of coding transcriptome during tripartite host-pathogen-vector interactions.']","['Narra, Hema P., [Sahni, Abha], [Alsing, Jessica], [Schroeder, Casey L.

Practicing different PPMs ranged from 48% for treating outdoor clothing with special bug-spray to 83% for walking on established trails. Using insect repellent on exposed skin was protective against TBD diagnosis [OR (95% CI): 0.55 (0.35, 0.88)]. A thorough body/clothes check after being outdoors was also protective against TBD diagnosis [OR (95% CI): 0.40 (0.25, 0.67)]. In stratified analyses, TBD knowledge, safety worry because of ticks, avoiding outdoors because of ticks, and pet TBD risk modified the associations between different PPMs and self-reported TBD diagnosis. In the state of Indiana, thorough body/clothes check after being outdoors and use of insect repellent on exposed skin might be strongly effective in preventing TBD. The protective effect of different PPMs might be stronger among people with high TBD knowledge, high safety worry because of ticks, high avoidance of being outdoors because of ticks, and low pet TBD risk. These results might be useful in the design of intervention programs.']","['Kianersi, Sina, [Luetke, Maya], [Wolfe, Caryn Gail], [Clark, William Alexander], [Omodior, OgheneKaro]']",['10.1007/s10900-020-00789-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00789-w'],[''],['Associations Between Personal Protective Measures and Self-Reported Tick-Borne Disease Diagnosis in Indiana Residents']
"['Parasites, and the diseases they cause, are important from an ecological and evolutionary perspective because they can negatively affect host fitness and can regulate host populations. Consequently, conservation biology has long recognized the vital role that parasites can play in the process of species endangerment and recovery. However, we are only beginning to understand how deeply parasites are embedded in ecological systems, and there is a growing recognition of the important ways in which parasites affect ecosystem structure and function. Thus, there is an urgent need to revisit how parasites are viewed from a conservation perspective and broaden the role that disease ecology plays in conservation-related research and outcomes. This review broadly focusses on the role that disease ecology can play in biological conservation. Our review specifically emphasizes on how the integration of tools and analytical approaches associated with both disease and molecular ecology can be leveraged to aid conservation biology. Our review first concentrates on disease-mediated extinctions and wildlife epidemics. We then focus on elucidating how host–parasite interactions has improved our understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics affecting hosts at the individual, population, community and ecosystem scales. We believe that the role of parasites as drivers and indicators of ecosystem health is especially an exciting area of research that has the potential to fundamentally alter our view of parasites and their role in biological conservation. The review concludes with a broad overview of the current and potential applications of modern genomic tools in disease ecology to aid biological conservation.']","['Gupta, Pooja, [Robin, V.

"['Background Assessing the burden of rickettsial infections in Ontario, Canada, is challenging since rickettsial infections are not reportable to public health. In the absence of reportable disease data, we assessed the burden of rickettsial infections by examining patient serological data and clinical information. Methods Our retrospective, cross-sectional study included patients who had Rickettsia serological testing ordered by their physician, in Ontario, from 2013 to 2018. We tested sera from 2755 non-travel patients for antibodies against spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and typhus group rickettsiae (TGR) using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (positive IgG titers ≥1:64). We classified cases using a sensitive surveillance case definition: confirmed (4-fold increase in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera with clinical evidence of infection), possible (single positive sera with clinical evidence) and previous rickettsial infection (single positive sera without clinical evidence). We classified cases seropositive for both SFGR and TGR as unspecified Rickettsia infections (URIs). Results Less than 5% of all patients had paired acute and convalescent sera tested, and of these, we found a single, laboratory-confirmed SFGR case, with a 4-fold increase in IgG titers and evidence of fever, maculopapular rash and headache. There were 45 possible (19 SFGR, 7 TGR, 19 URI) and 580 previous rickettsial infection (183 SFGR, 89 TGR, 308 URI) cases. The rate of positive tests for SFGR, TGR and URI combined (all case classifications) were 4.4 per 100,000 population. For confirmed and possible cases, the most common signs and symptoms were fever, headache, gastrointestinal complaints and maculopapular rash. The odds of having seropositive patients increased annually by 30% (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.39). Conclusions The rates of rickettsial infections in Ontario are difficult to determine. Based on confirmed and possible cases, rates are low, but inclusion of previous rickettsial infection cases would indicate higher rates. We highlight the need for education regarding the importance of testing acute and convalescent sera and consistent completion of the laboratory requisition in confirming rickettsial disease. We suggest further research in Ontario to investigate rickettsial agents in potential vectors and clinical studies employing PCR testing of clinical samples.']","['Nelder, Mark P., [Russell, Curtis B.], [Johnson, Steven], [Li, Ye], [Cronin, Kirby], [Warshawsky, Bryna], [Brandon, Nicholas], [Patel, Samir N.]']",['10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],[''],"['Assessing human exposure to spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae in Ontario, Canada (2013–2018): a retrospective, cross-sectional study']"

It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2–5\xa0°C in the next decades.

"['Context Studies have shown that land use and land cover change (LUCC) has myriad impacts on local and regional climate. Synthesizing the recent findings in this field helps advance landscape ecology and sustainability science in the face of climate change. Objectives To review and synthesize mesoscale modeling-based studies examining the impact of LUCC on climate, and to identify research gaps and future research directions. Methods We adopted a systematic review procedure to identify and analyze relevant literature obtained from the Web of Science spanning Jan 1990–Nov 2018. Results The number of publications per year increased from about 5 before 2008 to as large as 25 thereafter. About 60% of the case studies were focused on China and the US. Urbanization and agricultural development exerted a stronger influence on temperature than other LUCC modifications, with temperature changes generally between 1 and 2\xa0°C. The climate effect of forest loss and urbanization illustrated location-dependency, as similar landscape changes in different latitudes showed climate effects of opposite sign. Extensive irrigation and dam construction increased precipitation, while the impact of urbanization and forest cover change on precipitation was inconclusive (positive, neutral, and negative). Conclusions Understanding landscape and climate change interactions is essential for studying the ecology and sustainability of regional landscapes. Future research needs to: (1) understand climate effects resulting from land management change, (2) investigate climate change impacts on human health as induced or mediated by landscape changes, and (3) develop sustainable landscapes that can mitigate and adapt to climate change.']","['Cao, Qian, [Liu, Yupeng], [Georgescu, Matei], [Wu, Jianguo]']",['10.1007/s10980-020-01015-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01015-7'],[''],['Impacts of landscape changes on local and regional climate: a systematic review']

Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks play a vital role as vectors in the transmission of Anaplasma pathogens. However, the Anaplasma species carried by H. longicornis in China are yet to be characterized. In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools. All tick sample pools were examined for the presence of Anaplasma species via nested PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA, major surface protein 4 ( msp4 ), or citric acid synthase ( gltA ) genes, which were sequenced to determine the molecular and phylogenetic characteristics of the isolates. The overall Anaplasma spp-positive rate of H. longicornis was determined to be 26.68% (99/371). The percentage prevalence of A. phagocytophilum -like1, A. bovis , A. ovis , A. marginale , and A. capra were 1.08% (4/371), 13.21% (49/371), 13.21% (49/371), 1.35% (5/371), and 10.24% (38/371), respectively, and the co-infection rate of two or more types of Anaplasma was 6.47% (24/371).

"['Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and are an increasing threat to human and animal health. Assessing disease risk and developing new control strategies requires identifying members of the\xa0tick-borne microbiota\xa0as well as their temporal dynamics and interactions. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we studied the Ixodes ricinus\xa0 microbiota and its temporal\xa0dynamics. 371 nymphs were\xa0monthly\xa0collected during three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia . Finally, more specific network analyses\xa0were performed on TBP-infected samples and\xa0suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia , Anaplasma and Rickettsia may disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus . Conclusions We identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented marked shifts in tick microbiota dynamics over time. Statistically, we showed strong relationships between the presence of specific pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus microbiota. We detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks.

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a deep learning model pre-trained with millions of annotated images in Imagenet, against a shallow custom-build convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA. We created a dataset of approximately 2000 images of four tick species ( Ixodes scapularis , Dermacentor variabilis , Amblyomma americanum and Haemaphysalis sp . ), two sexes (male, female) and two life stages (adult, nymph). We used these tick images to train two separate CNN models – ResNet-50 and a simple shallow custom-built. We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s).

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']

"['ELISA methods are the diagnostic tools recommended for the serological diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii infection in ruminants but their respective diagnostic performances are difficult to assess because of the absence of a gold standard. This study focused on three commercial ELISA tests with the following objectives (1) assess their sensitivity and specificity in sheep, goats and cattle, (2) assess the between- and within-herd seroprevalence distribution in these species, accounting for diagnostic errors, and (3) estimate optimal sample sizes considering sensitivity and specificity at herd level. We comparatively tested 1413 cattle, 1474 goat and 1432 sheep serum samples collected in France. We analyzed the cross-classified test results with a hierarchical zero-inflated beta-binomial latent class model considering each herd as a population and conditional dependence as a fixed effect. Potential biases and coverage probabilities of the model were assessed by simulation. Conditional dependence for truly seropositive animals was high in all species for two of the three ELISA methods. Specificity estimates were high, ranging from 94.8% [92.1; 97.8] to 99.2% [98.5; 99.7], whereas sensitivity estimates were generally low, ranging from 39.3 [30.7; 47.0] to 90.5% [83.3; 93.8]. Between- and within-herd seroprevalence estimates varied greatly among geographic areas and herds. Overall, goats showed higher within-herd seroprevalence levels than sheep and cattle. The optimal sample size maximizing both herd sensitivity and herd specificity varied from 3 to at least 20 animals depending on the test and ruminant species. This study provides better interpretation of three widely used commercial ELISA tests and will make it possible to optimize their implementation in future studies. The methodology developed may likewise be applied to other human or animal diseases.']","['Lurier, Thibaut, [Rousset, Elodie], [Gasqui, Patrick], [Sala, Carole], [Claustre, Clément], [Abrial, David], [Dufour, Philippe], [Crémoux, Renée], [Gache, Kristel], [Delignette-Muller, Marie Laure], [Ayral, Florence], [Jourdain, Elsa]']",['10.1186/s13567-021-00926-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00926-w'],[''],['Evaluation using latent class models of the diagnostic performances of three ELISA tests commercialized for the serological diagnosis of Coxiella burnetii infection in domestic ruminants']

The study provides new insights about the above objectives in a global context and therefore performed. After a preliminary review of the 610 papers representing objective areas, 241 were selected for detailed meta-analysis. In general, the global ranks of tick species were, respectively, between 0.01–85.4% and 1–53 for human infestation rates and records. Twenty-six and sixteen tick species have more than 10% and 10 records of human tick infestation rates and records, respectively. It seems these tick species tend to be more blood-feeding on humans and as a result can be more dangerous to humans. The outcome of study demonstrated that there is no difference between seasonal human tick infestation patterns in the northern and southern hemispheres. The most global monthly mean tick bites in humans were observed in June then followed in July, August, May, and September. The global annually and periodically trends of tick infestation rates in humans exhibited decreasing trends over the past decades suggesting the preventive measure to prohibit human tick infestation have been successful.

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Purpose A comprehensive systematic meta-analysis review which deals with the degrees and trends of human infestation by biological stages of ticks, the degrees and trends of human infestation by biological stages of ticks in rural and urban areas, the infestation scale of tick attachment sites in body parts of humans, and the degrees of tick infestation in human age groups is critical. Therefore, this systematic meta-analysis review summarizes the above-detailed human infestation spectrums about biological stages of hard ticks. Methods After a preliminary review from 605 papers representing areas of the study objectives, 96 were selected for detailed human infestation spectrums of biological stages of hard ticks. Results In general, the results suggest that the adult ticks, and mostly females attack humans more than larval and nymphalid ones, and adult males, respectively. Unlike the trends of human infestation by larval and nymphalid stages of ticks, and the adult, male and female ticks which exhibited approximately a sharply decreasing trend, the global trend of human infestation by hard ticks exhibited approximately a sharply increasing trend over time. Ticks attack humans more in rural area than urban area. Also, the trends of human tick infestation in rural and urban areas exhibit, respectively, a sharp increase and decrease trends over time. Conclusions The majority of ticks mostly attach to human body trunk and extremity than head and neck, and genital area.

"['Background Theileria orientalis is a tick-borne hemoparasite that causes anemia, ill thrift, and death in cattle globally. The Ikeda strain of T. orientalis is more virulent than other strains, leading to severe clinical signs and death of up to 5% of affected animals. Within the Asia–Pacific region, where it affects 25% of Australian cattle, T. orientalis Ikeda has a significant economic impact on the cattle industry. In 2017, T. orientalis Ikeda was detected in a cattle herd in Albermarle County, Virginia, United States. Months earlier, the U.S. was alerted to the invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, throughout the eastern U.S. Abundant H. longicornis ticks were identified on cattle in the T. orientalis- affected herd in VA, and a subset of ticks from the environment were PCR-positive for T. orientalis Ikeda. A strain of T. orientalis from a previous U.S. outbreak was not transmissible by H. longicornis ; however, H. longicornis is the primary tick vector of T. orientalis Ikeda in other regions of the world. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether invasive H. longicornis ticks in the U.S. are competent vectors of T. orientalis Ikeda. Methods Nymphal H. longicornis ticks were fed on a splenectomized calf infected with the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. After molting, a subset of adult ticks from this cohort were dissected, and salivary glands assayed for T. orientalis Ikeda via qPCR. The remaining adult ticks from the group were allowed to feed on three calves. Calves were subsequently monitored for T. orientalis Ikeda infection via blood smear cytology and PCR. Results After acquisition feeding on a VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda-infected calf as nymphs, a subset of molted adult tick salivary glands tested positive by qPCR for T. orientalis Ikeda. Adult ticks from the same cohort successfully transmitted T. orientalis Ikeda to 3/3 naïve calves, each of which developed parasitemia reaching 0.4–0.9%. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that U.S. H. longicornis ticks are competent vectors of the VA-U.S.- T. orientalis Ikeda strain. This data provides important information for the U.S. cattle industry regarding the potential spread of this parasite and the necessity of enhanced surveillance and control measures.']","['Dinkel, Kelcey D., [Herndon, David R.], [Noh, Susan M.], [Lahmers, Kevin K.], [Todd, S.

"['Background Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD . As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. Results We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins ( n =645) than uninfected ticks ( n =376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Conclusion Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H 2 O 2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H 2 O 2 , and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H 2 O 2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD.']","['Kim, Tae Kwon, [Tirloni, Lucas], [Bencosme-Cuevas, Emily], [Kim, Tae Heung], [Diedrich, Jolene K.], [Yates, John R., III], [Mulenga, Albert]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07429-0'],[''],['Borrelia burgdorferi infection modifies protein content in saliva of Ixodes scapularis nymphs']

However, since Koch described this group in 1844, the systematics of its members has been the subject of ongoing debate. This is especially true of A. maculatum and A. triste ; recent molecular analyses reveal insufficient genetic divergence to separate these as distinct species. Further confounding this issue is the discovery in 2014 of A. maculatum group ticks in southern Arizona (AZ), USA, that share morphological characteristics with both A. triste and A. maculatum .

"['Background Pyroptosis is a recently identified pathway of caspase-mediated cell death in response to microbes, lipopolysaccharide, or chemotherapy in certain types of cells. However, the mechanism of how pyroptosis is regulated is not well-established. Methods Herein, the intracellular bacteria were detected by staining and laser confocal microscopy and TEM. Live/dead cell imaging assay was used to examine macrophage death. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to examine the protein changes. IFA was used to identify typical budding vesicles of pyroptosis and the STAT3 nuclear localization. SEM was used to observe the morphological characteristics of pyroptosis. ELISA was used to detect the level of inflammatory cytokines. Pyroptosis was filmed in macrophages by LSCM. Results S. aureus was internalized by human macrophages. Intracellular S. aureus induced macrophage death. S. aureus invasion increased the expression of NLRP3, Caspase1 (Casp-1 p20) and the accumulation of GSDMD-NT, GSDMD-NT pore structures, and the release of IL-1β and IL-18 in macrophages. Macrophages pyroptosis induced by S. aureus can be abrogated by blockage of S. aureus phagocytosis. The pyroptosic effect by S. aureus infection was promoted by either rapamycin or Stattic, a specific inhibitor for mTORC1 or STAT3. Inhibition of mTORC1 or STAT3 induced pyroptosis. mTORC1 regulated the pyroptosic gene expression through governing the nuclear localization of STAT3. mTORC1/STAT3 axis may play a regulatory role in pyroptosis within macrophages. Conclusions S. aureus infection induces human macrophage pyroptosis, inhibition of mTORC1/STAT3 axis facilitates S. aureus -induced pyroptosis. mTORC1 and STAT3 are associated with pyroptosis. Our findings demonstrate a regulatory function of the mTORC1/STAT3 axis in macrophage pyroptosis, constituting a novel mechanism by which pyroptosis is regulated in macrophages.

"['N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is by far the most used repellent worldwide. When applied topically to the skin, the active ingredient has been shown to provide protection from a variety of hematophagous insects, including mosquitoes and flies. DEET’s effectiveness against ticks is influenced by a variety of factors (e.g., duration and concentration of application, drying time, route of exposure, tick species and developmental stage), and may differ from insects due to their unique chemosensory system that primarily involves the Haller’s organ. We therefore used several approaches to investigate DEET’s efficacy to repel Dermacentor variabilis at different concentrations (5, 30 or 75%), as well as explore its toxicological properties and natural variability in DEET insensitivity across populations from Manitoba, Canada. Climbing bioassays indicated that higher concentrations of DEET were more effective at repelling D. variabilis , and that ticks from some sampling localities were more sensitive to lower concentrations than others. Petri dish arena assays revealed ticks exposed to high concentrations of the repellent lose their ability to discriminate lower concentrations, perhaps due to overstimulation or habituation. Finally, our tactile assays demonstrated reduced tick survival after contact with high DEET concentrations, with mortality occurring more rapidly with increased concentration. Dermacentor variabilis from these tactile assays displayed a multitude of physiological and neurological symptoms, such as ‘hot foot’ and various bodily secretions. Overall, our study shows a strong association between repellency, concentration and the acaricidal effects of DEET on D. variabilis .']","['Koloski, Cody W., [Duncan, Carlyn A.

A total of 100 partially engorged female ticks were taken from tick samples collected from camels ( n \u2009=\u2009100; 50/year) and subjected to DNA extraction and sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform to elucidate the bacterial communities. Principle Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was conducted to determine patterns of diversity in bacterial communities. In 2010 and 2019, we obtained 899,574 and 781,452 read counts and these formed 371 and 191 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity), respectively. In both years, twenty-five bacterial families with high relative abundance were detected and the following were the most common: Moraxellaceae , Enterobacteriaceae , Staphylococcaceae , Bacillaceae , Corynebacteriaceae , Flavobacteriaceae , Francisellaceae , Muribaculaceae , Neisseriaceae , and Pseudomonadaceae . Francisellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae coexist in H. dromedarii and we suggest that they thrive under similar conditions and microbial interactions inside the host. Comparisons of diversity indicated that microbial communities differed in terms of richness and evenness between 2010 and 2019, with higher richness but lower evenness in communities in 2010. Principle coordinates analyses showed clear clusters separating microbial communities in 2010 and 2019. The differences in communities suggested that the repertoire of microbial communities have shifted. In particular, the significant increase in dominance of Francisella and the presence of bacterial families containing pathogenic genera shows that H. dromedarii poses a serious health risk to camels and people who interact with them.

"['Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK–STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host.

"['Background Pathogenic Rickettsia species belonging to the spotted fever group are arthropod-borne, obligate intracellular bacteria which exhibit preferential tropism for host microvascular endothelium in the mammalian hosts, resulting in disease manifestations attributed primarily to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Although rickettsiae are known to undergo evolution through genomic reduction, the mechanisms by which these pathogens regulate their transcriptome to ensure survival in tick vectors and maintenance by transovarial/transstadial transmission, in contrast to their ability to cause debilitating infections in human hosts remain unknown. In this study, we compare the expression profiles of rickettsial sRNAome/transcriptome and determine the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of R. conorii transcripts during in vitro infection of human and tick host cells. Results We performed deep sequencing on total RNA from Amblyomma americanum AAE2 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) infected with R. conorii . Strand-specific RNA sequencing of R. conorii transcripts revealed the expression 32 small RNAs ( Rc _sR’s), which were preferentially expressed above the limit of detection during tick cell infection, and confirmed the expression of Rc _sR61, sR71, and sR74 by quantitative RT-PCR. Intriguingly, a total of 305 and 132 R. conorii coding genes were differentially upregulated (>\u20092-fold) in AAE2 cells and HMECs, respectively. Further, enrichment for primary transcripts by treatment with Terminator 5′-Phosphate-dependent Exonuclease resulted in the identification of 3903 and 2555 transcription start sites (TSSs), including 214 and 181 primary TSSs in R. conorii during the infection to tick and human host cells, respectively. Seventy-five coding genes exhibited different TSSs depending on the host environment. Finally, we also observed differential expression of 6S RNA during host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interactions in vitro, implicating an important role for this noncoding RNA in the regulation of rickettsial transcriptome depending on the supportive host niche. Conclusions In sum, the findings of this study authenticate the presence of novel Rc _sR’s in R. conorii, reveal the first evidence for differential expression of coding transcripts and utilization of alternate transcriptional start sites depending on the host niche, and implicate a role for 6S RNA in the regulation of coding transcriptome during tripartite host-pathogen-vector interactions.']","['Narra, Hema P., [Sahni, Abha], [Alsing, Jessica], [Schroeder, Casey L.

"['Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is endemic in twenty-seven European countries, transmitted via the bite of an infected tick. TBEV is the causative agent of one of the most important viral diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). In Germany, 890 human cases were registered between the years 2018–2019. The castor bean tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the TBEV vector with the highest importance in Central Europe, including Germany. Despite the nationwide distribution of this tick species, risk areas of TBEV are largely located in Southern Germany. To increase our understanding of TBEV-tick interactions, we collected ticks from different areas within Germany (Haselmühl/Bavaria, Hanover/Lower Saxony) and infected them via an in vitro feeding system. A TBEV isolate was obtained from an endemic focus in Haselmühl. In two experimental series conducted in 2018 and 2019, ticks sampled in Haselmühl (TBEV focus) showed higher artificial feeding rates, as well as higher TBEV infections rates than ticks from the non-endemic area (Hanover). Other than the tick origin, year and month of the infection experiment as well as co-infection with Borrelia spp., had a significant impact on TBEV Haselmühl infection rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that a specific adaptation of the tick populations to their respective TBEV virus isolates or vice versa, leads to higher TBEV infection rates in those ticks. Furthermore, co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia spp. can lower TBEV infection rates in specific populations.']","['Liebig, Katrin, [Boelke, Mathias], [Grund, Domenic], [Schicht, Sabine], [Springer, Andrea], [Strube, Christina], [Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia], [Dobler, Gerhard], [Jung, Klaus], [Becker, Stefanie]']",['10.1038/s41598-020-71920-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71920-z'],[''],['Tick populations from endemic and non-endemic areas in Germany show differential susceptibility to TBEV']

In the absence of reportable disease data, we assessed the burden of rickettsial infections by examining patient serological data and clinical information. Methods Our retrospective, cross-sectional study included patients who had Rickettsia serological testing ordered by their physician, in Ontario, from 2013 to 2018. We tested sera from 2755 non-travel patients for antibodies against spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and typhus group rickettsiae (TGR) using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (positive IgG titers ≥1:64). We classified cases using a sensitive surveillance case definition: confirmed (4-fold increase in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera with clinical evidence of infection), possible (single positive sera with clinical evidence) and previous rickettsial infection (single positive sera without clinical evidence). We classified cases seropositive for both SFGR and TGR as unspecified Rickettsia infections (URIs). Results Less than 5% of all patients had paired acute and convalescent sera tested, and of these, we found a single, laboratory-confirmed SFGR case, with a 4-fold increase in IgG titers and evidence of fever, maculopapular rash and headache. There were 45 possible (19 SFGR, 7 TGR, 19 URI) and 580 previous rickettsial infection (183 SFGR, 89 TGR, 308 URI) cases. The rate of positive tests for SFGR, TGR and URI combined (all case classifications) were 4.4 per 100,000 population. For confirmed and possible cases, the most common signs and symptoms were fever, headache, gastrointestinal complaints and maculopapular rash. The odds of having seropositive patients increased annually by 30% (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.39). Conclusions The rates of rickettsial infections in Ontario are difficult to determine. Based on confirmed and possible cases, rates are low, but inclusion of previous rickettsial infection cases would indicate higher rates. We highlight the need for education regarding the importance of testing acute and convalescent sera and consistent completion of the laboratory requisition in confirming rickettsial disease.

A sparse, stable, and genetically diverse population of ticks in the Southeastern US, that is rarely infected with the agent of LB is genetically distinct from an abundant, expanding, and comparatively uniform population in the Northeast, where epidemic LB now constitutes the most important vector borne disease in the United States. The contrasting geography and demography of tick populations, interpreted in the context of the geological history of the region, suggests that during the last glacial period such ticks occupied distinct refugia, with only the northern-most site of refuge giving rise to those ticks and pathogens now fueling the epidemic.']","['Xu, Guang, [Wielstra, Ben], [Rich, Stephen M.]']",['10.1038/s41598-020-67259-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67259-0'],[''],['Northern and southern blacklegged (deer) ticks are genetically distinct with different histories and Lyme spirochete infection rates']

"['The aim of this study was to evaluate energetic source used by juveniles of a terrestrial oviparous invertebrate during the earliest periods of their life. Growth, behavioural activities and energy contents of Pardosa saltans spiderlings’ residual vitellus were monitored during 8\xa0days after their emergence from their egg-sac until they disperse autonomously. The life-cycle of juvenile after emergence can be divided into three periods: a gregarious while juveniles are aggregated on their mother, dismounting off their mother’s back and dispersion. We present the first biochemical study of residual vitellus and energy expenditure during these three periods. At emergence, the mean weight of juveniles was 0.59\xa0mg and energy stock from residual vitellus averaged 51\xa0cal/g wet mass. During gregarious period, the weight of the juveniles aggregated on their mother did not vary significantly and juveniles utilized only 1\xa0cal/day from their residual vitellus. During the period from dismounting until their first exogenous feed, juveniles lost weight and used 30% of their residual vitellus stock. Proteins from the residual vitellus contributed principally to their energy expenditure during this period: 1.5\xa0µg protein/day. Juveniles’ first exogenous feeding was observed 7–8\xa0days after emergence, when 70% of residual vitellus energy had been utilized. Juveniles dispersed after eating, reconstituting an energy stock comparable to that observed at emergence from egg-sac (50\xa0cal/g wet mass).

"['White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the causative agent of white spot syndrome (WSS), a disease that has led to severe mortality rates in cultured shrimp all over the world. The WSSV is a large, ellipsoid, enveloped double-stranded DNA virus with a wide host range among crustaceans. Currently, the main antiviral method is to block the receptor of the host cell membrane using recombinant viral proteins or virus antiserum. In addition to interference with the ligand-receptor binding, disrupting the structure of the virus envelope may also be a means to combat the viral infection. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are carbonaceous nanoparticles that have many advantageous characteristics, including small size, low cytotoxicity, cheap, and ease of production and modification. Polyamine-modified CQDs (polyamine CQDs) with strong antibacterial ability have been identified, previously. In this study, polyamine CQDs are shown to attach to the WSSV envelope and inhibit the virus infection, with a dose-dependent effect. The results also show that polyamine CQDs can upregulate several immune genes in shrimp and reduce the mortality upon WSSV infection. This is first study to identify that polyamine CQDs could against the virus. These results, indeed, provide a direction to develop effective antiviral strategies or therapeutic methods using polyamine CQDs in aquaculture.']","['Huang, Huai-Ting, [Lin, Han-Jia], [Huang, Hui-Ju], [Huang, Chih-Ching], [Lin, John Han-You], [Chen, Li-Li]']",['10.1038/s41598-020-64325-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64325-5'],[''],['Synthesis and evaluation of polyamine carbon quantum dots (CQDs) in Litopenaeus vannamei as a therapeutic agent against WSSV']
"['Background From a veterinary-medical point of view, the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans , is perhaps the economically most important blood-sucking muscoid fly species (Diptera: Muscidae), owing to its worldwide occurrence, frequently high local abundance, direct harm caused to livestock, pet animals and humans, as well as its vector role. Considering the latter in the context of protozoan parasites, the stable fly is a mechanical vector of trypanosomes and Besnoitia besnoiti . However, its role as a vector of piroplasms appears to be seldom studied, despite old data suggesting mechanical transmission of babesiae by dipteran flies. Methods In this study 395 stable flies (and one Haematobia stimulans ) were collected at a cattle farm with known history of bovine theileriosis, and at further nine, randomly chosen locations in Hungary. These flies were separated according to sex (30 of them also cut into two parts: the head with mouthparts and the thorax-abdomen), followed by individual DNA extraction, then screening for piroplasms by PCR and sequencing. Results In stable flies, Theileria orientalis \xa0and T. capreoli were identified at the cattle farm and T. equi was identified in three other locations. At the cattle farm, significantly more male stable flies carried piroplasm DNA than females. There was no significant difference between the ratio of PCR-positive flies between the stable (void of cattle for at least two hours) and the pen on the pasture with cattle at the time of sampling. Among dissected flies (29 S. calcitrans and 1 H. stimulans ), exclusively the thoracic-abdominal parts were PCR-positive, whereas the head and mouthparts remained negative. Conclusions Theileria DNA is detectable in stable flies, in the case of T. orientalis at least for two hours after blood-feeding, and in the case of T. capreoli also in the absence of infected hosts (i.e. roe deer). Male flies rather than females, and thoracic-abdominal (most likely crop) contents rather than mouthparts may pose a risk of mechanical transmission. These data suggest that it is worth to study further the vector role of stable flies in the epidemiology of theilerioses, in which not the immediate, but rather the delayed type transmission seems possible.']","['Hornok, Sándor, [Takács, Nóra], [Szekeres, Sándor], [Szőke, Krisztina], [Kontschán, Jenő], [Horváth, Gábor], [Sugár, László]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04041-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04041-1'],[''],"['DNA of Theileria orientalis, T. equi and T. capreoli in stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans)']"

Different tree structures with different numbers of groups for market participants have been proposed, with no clear, consistent tree used in the literature. One of the main causes of this inconsistency is that these trees are artificially proposed through a bottom-up approach rather than implied by actual market data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that infers a tree structure directly from empirical data. More precisely, we use hierarchical clustering to construct a tree for each individual firm and then infer an aggregate tree through a voting mechanism. We test this method on US data from January 2002 for 7608 companies, which results in a tree with two layers and four groups. The characteristics of the resulting aggregate tree are between those of several proposed tree structures in the literature, demonstrating that these proposed trees all reflect only part of the market, and one should consider the proposed empirically driven method when seeking a tree representing the whole market.']","['Lin, Emily, [Kao, Chu-Lan Michael], [Adityarini, Natasha Sonia]']",['10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11156-021-00961-w'],[''],['Data-driven tree structure for PIN models']

"['Formative assessment practices for secondary mathematics have been advocated as valuable for students, but difficult for teachers to learn. There have been calls in the literature to increase the emphasis on formative assessment in mathematics teacher preparation courses. This study explored the use of peer-assessment strategies for helping pre-service secondary mathematics teachers (PSTs) cultivate formative assessment principles and practices for assessing school students. Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of: sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments. We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in Practice to characterize the PSTs’ perceptions of their experience of formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students, in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on average less confidence in assessing school student task responses themselves than in assessing peer work. In addition to highlighting specific changes to different types of assessment knowledge, the PSTs also evidenced an awareness of shifts in their attitudes, in coming to view student task responses with more appreciation and humility.']","['Ayalon, Michal, [Wilkie, Karina J.]']",['10.1007/s10857-020-09465-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10857-020-09465-1'],[''],['Investigating peer-assessment strategies for mathematics pre-service teacher learning on formative assessment']
"['Stochastic frontier analysis and quantile regression are the two econometric approaches that have been commonly adopted in the determination of the self-thinning boundary line or surface in two and higher dimensions since their introduction to the field some 20\xa0years ago. However, the rational for using one method over the other has, in most cases, not been clearly explained perhaps due to a lack of adequate appreciation of differences between the two approaches for delineating the self-thinning surface. Without an adequate understanding of such differences, the most informative analysis may become a missed opportunity, leading to an inefficient use of data, weak statistical inferences and a failure to gain greater insight into the dynamics of plant populations and forest stands that would otherwise be obtained. Using data from 170 plot measurements in even-aged Larix olgensis (A. Henry) plantations across a wide range of site qualities and with different abundances of woody weeds, i.e. naturally regenerated non-crop species, in northeast China, this study compared the two methods in determining the self-thinning surface across eight sample sizes from 30 to 170 with an even interval of 20 observations and also over a range of quantiles through repeated random sampling and estimation. Across all sample sizes and over the quantile range of 0.90\u2009≤\u2009 τ \u2009≤\u20090.99, the normal-half normal stochastic frontier estimation proved to be superior to quantile regression in statistical efficiency. Its parameter estimates had lower degrees of variability and correspondingly narrower confidence intervals. This greater efficiency would naturally be conducive to making statistical inferences. The estimated self-thinning surface using all 170 observations enveloped about 96.5% of the data points, a degree of envelopment equivalent to a regression quantile estimation with a τ of 0.965. The stochastic frontier estimation was also more objective because it did not involve the subjective selection of a particular value of τ for the favoured self-thinning surface from several mutually intersecting surfaces as in quantile regression. However, quantile regression could still provide a valuable complement to stochastic frontier analysis in the estimation of the self-thinning surface as it allows the examination of the impact of variables other than stand density on different quantiles of stand biomass.']","['Tian, Dechao, [Bi, Huiquan], [Jin, Xingji], [Li, Fengri]']",['10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01196-6'],[''],['Stochastic frontiers or regression quantiles for estimating the self-thinning surface in higher dimensions?']

"['Distinguishing among commercial varieties or accessions in a germplasm repository presents considerable challenges when dealing with common crops or large collections. In the genus Pisum L. the third intron of the gene STAYGREEN ( SGR ), responsible for the green/yellow cotyledon variation, contains a complex of repeat sequences that display considerable indel and single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism. In a sample of 137 Pisum L. accessions obtained from various germplasm collections 76 alleles were identified, ranging from about 600 to 1500 nucleotides in length. In most cases alleles differed by insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms in addition to single base changes. The amplicon was particularly useful for distinguishing wild accessions (those with dehiscent pods and dormant seeds). Among the 51 P . sativum L. accessions examined with a definite wild phenotype there were 44 SGR alleles. When this allelic variation was combined with location data for the wild accessions, each allele could be assigned a unique geographical location. Similarly, of the 10 P. fulvum Sibth. & Sm. accessions analyzed, only a group of three had the same allele, two of which are known to be replicates. We were able to confirm the identities of several P . sativum accessions from different germplasm collections, as well as identifying two cases where supposedly synonymous accessions gave different intron sequences. In addition, a group of wild pea accessions from Greece, Sicily, and Portugal exhibited a unique repeat sequence not found in any other wild accession, suggesting that these accessions constitute a distinct lineage. The rate of nucleotide site variation in this fragment of the SGR locus was found to be about 2.22 × 10 –8 substitutions per site per year. This value is similar to those found for many other sequences in herbaceous papilionoid tribes, although it is at the faster end of the distribution of herbaceous legume substitution rates. We propose that both a fast substitution rate as well as the formation and rearrangement of indels have contributed to the high level of variation we detected at SGR . This PCR product should prove valuable in the identification of Pisum accessions, for quality control operations in germplasm repositories, and for exploring the evolutionary relationships within the genus.']","['Weeden, Norman F., [Coyne, Clarice J.], [Lavin, Matthew], [McPhee, Kevin]']",['10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01152-1'],[''],['Distinguishing among Pisum accessions using a hypervariable intron within Mendel’s green/yellow cotyledon gene']

Both individuals were positively food-conditioned and showed increasing habituation caused by irresponsible behaviour of people such as long-lasting intentional feeding or illegal keeping.

In this article, I explore the linkages between managers’ tribal identity and political contestability among firms in Ghana.

Most experiments were on fluorescence from a thin layer of either 1% toluene, 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene, anisole (methoxybenzene), 1,3-xylene, 1-methylnaphthalene, or 10% 3-pentanone, while room-temperature absorption and fluorescence spectra were also recorded for acetone and 2-butanone. The fluorescence behavior is qualitatively consistent with previous findings. In particular, the signal from all species significantly decreases with increasing temperature. Unexpectedly, the fluorescence signal from the aromatic species increases with the accumulated number of laser shots the sample has been exposed to, saturating a factor of two to three-and-a-half higher than measured from the first laser shot. Further investigations suggest that laser irradiation drives dissolved oxygen from the liquid, reducing collisional quenching by oxygen.

Therefore, teaching methodologies such as CLIL and EMI have entered into the education system, so far with mixed results. The purpose of this classroom-based evaluation research was to investigate the effectiveness of implementing CLIL into a primary school in Southern Taiwan. The 5-week course centered around the topic of insects, and the lesson plans were based on Coyle’s [ 1 ] 4Cs model. Content and cognition were connected through use of the Language Triptych, and relevant topics on culture were also incorporated into the lessons. The students were given a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest on the course content, and they completed questionnaires upon completion of the study. The students showed significant improvement on their posttests and received passing scores on their delayed posttests. The students’ responses on their questionnaires showed that overall they enjoyed participating in CLIL, they believed that their English improved from learning the CLIL content, and they were motivated to participate in future CLIL courses. Due to the students’ limitations in linguistic ability, it was difficult to assess the students’ improvements or lack thereof in content knowledge, as they were unable to express this knowledge in English. However, overall CLIL was deemed to be an effective choice for primary school students as they learned the content and enjoyed the course.

We argue that worldly internalism faces serious difficulties and that its apparent advantages are illusory. First, it cannot adequately handle some not terribly strange cases of perceptual error. Second, it cannot explain why one should plan to use their evidence to update their beliefs.

"['Purpose Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is a common cause of work absence. The recent SWAP (Study of Work And Pain) randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that a brief vocational advice service for primary care patients with MSK pain led to fewer days’ work absence and provided good return-on-investment. The I-SWAP (Implementation of the Study of Work And Pain) initiative aimed to deliver an implementation test-bed of the SWAP vocational advice intervention with First Contact Practitioners (FCP). This entailed adapting the SWAP vocational advice training to fit the FCP role. This qualitative investigation explored the implementation potential of FCPs delivering vocational advice for patients with MSK pain. Methods Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 10 FCPs and 5 GPs. Data were analysed thematically and findings explored using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Results I-SWAP achieved a degree of ‘coherence’ (i.e. made sense), with both FCPs and GPs feeling FCPs were well-placed to discuss work issues with these patients. However, for many of the FCPs, addressing or modifying psychosocial and occupational barriers to return-to-work was not considered feasible within FCP consultations, and improving physical function was prioritised. Concerns were also raised that employers would not act on FCPs’ recommendations regarding return-to-work. Conclusion FCPs appear well-placed to discuss work issues with MSK patients, and signpost/refer to other services; however, because they often only see patients once they are less suited to deliver other aspects of vocational advice. Future research is needed to explore how best to provide vocational advice in primary care settings.']","['Saunders, Benjamin, [Foster, Nadine E.], [Hill, Jonathan C.], [Sowden, Gail], [Evans, Nicola], [Bishop, Annette], [Stynes, Siobhan], [Dziedzic, Krysia], [Campbell, Laura], [Rankin, Gabrielle], [Salmon, Paula], [Wynne-Jones, Gwenllian]']",['10.1007/s10926-021-09992-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10926-021-09992-5'],[''],['First Contact Practitioners’ (FCPs) and General Practitioners’ Perceptions Towards FCPs Delivering Vocational Advice to Patients with Musculoskeletal Conditions: A Qualitative Investigation of the Implementation Potential of the I-SWAP Initiative']

In this study, 1074 H. longicornis specimens were collected from goats in four provinces of China from 2018 to 2019 and divided into 371 sample pools.

"['Histone exchange between histones carrying position-specific marks and histones bearing general marks is important for gene regulation, but understanding of histone exchange remains incomplete. To overcome the poor time resolution of conventional pulse–chase histone labeling, we present a genetically encoded histone exchange timer sensitive to the duration that two tagged histone subunits co-reside at an individual genomic locus. We apply these sensors to map genome-wide patterns of histone exchange in yeast using single samples. Comparing H3 exchange in cycling and G1-arrested cells suggests that replication-independent H3 exchange occurs at several hundred nucleosomes (<1% of all nucleosomes) per minute, with a maximal rate at histone promoters. We observed substantial differences between the two nucleosome core subcomplexes: H2A-H2B subcomplexes undergo rapid transcription-dependent replacement within coding regions, whereas H3-H4 replacement occurs predominantly within promoter nucleosomes, in association with gene activation or repression. Our timers allow the in vivo study of histone exchange dynamics with minute time scale resolution.

"['The explosion of online information with the recent advent of digital technology in information processing, information storing, information sharing, natural language processing, and text mining techniques has enabled stock investors to uncover market movement and volatility from heterogeneous content. For example, a typical stock market investor reads the news, explores market sentiment, and analyzes technical details in order to make a sound decision prior to purchasing or selling a particular company’s stock. However, capturing a dynamic stock market trend is challenging owing to high fluctuation and the non-stationary nature of the stock market. Although existing studies have attempted to enhance stock prediction, few have provided a complete decision-support system for investors to retrieve real-time data from multiple sources and extract insightful information for sound decision-making. To address the above challenge, we propose a unified solution for data collection, analysis, and visualization in real-time stock market prediction to retrieve and process relevant financial data from news articles, social media, and company technical information. We aim to provide not only useful information for stock investors but also meaningful visualization that enables investors to effectively interpret storyline events affecting stock prices. Specifically, we utilize an ensemble stacking of diversified machine-learning-based estimators and innovative contextual feature engineering to predict the next day’s stock prices. Experiment results show that our proposed stock forecasting method outperforms a traditional baseline with an average mean absolute percentage error of 0.93.

"['With the societal cracks resulting from decade-long neoliberal policies becoming increasingly visible in many countries, capitalism as the most suitable institutional system to produce material wealth, environmental sustainability and social stability has come under growing attack. This contribution examines what the growing army of recent heterodox scholars in economics and business have to say on what one could call ‘inclusive capitalism’. This concerns both the flaws in current capitalist systems and the behavioral assumptions that underpin it, as well as the possible institutional fixes they propose. I first sketch the background of the crisis surrounding capitalism, delve into its conceptual foundations and offer a working definition. I subsequently examine what social and environmental inclusion refer to and use Kate Raworth’s conceptualization of the doughnut economy as a point of departure to explore what ‘inclusive capitalism’ may imply. I also identify requirements for its implementation in institutional practices. It appears that ‘purpose’ rather than utility maximization or profit maximization is what novel economists and business scholars perceive as the key driver in ‘stakeholder-oriented capitalism’ or the ‘economics of mutuality’. Their claim is that at the end of the day this is not only a moral imperative for companies but also more beneficial for them in terms of long-term profitability. Moreover, they see a far more important role for government in shaping markets and leading the way into a more inclusive future than it is currently fulfilling.

Non-parasitic stages were held at 18 and 28\xa0°C to study the effect of temperature on development and survival. In our experiments, H. marginatum ticks have maintained the characteristics of a two-host life cycle.

The life cycle duration of H. marginatum was influenced by temperature, with each non-parasitic stage—i.e., larva and nymph molting—developing faster at 28 than at 18\xa0°C; preoviposition and oviposition periods were shorter at 28 than at 18\xa0°C. At 18\xa0°C, no eggs hatched. The whole cycle from the collection of an engorged field tick until the emergence of second-generation larvae took 189\xa0days.

Unlike other marine shrimps, the ovaries in adult female M. nipponense can mature rapidly and periodically during the reproductive period, but the resulting high stocking densities and environmental deterioration can negatively impact the harvest yield and economic benefits. To better understand ovary development in female M. nipponense , we performed systematic transcriptome sequencing of five different stages of ovarian maturation. Results We obtained 255,966 Gb of high quality transcriptome data from 15 samples. Of the 105,082 unigenes that were selected, 30,878 were successfully annotated. From these unigenes, we identified 17 differentially expressed genes and identified three distinct gene expression patterns related to different biological processes. We found that cathepins, legumains, and cystatin were enriched in the lysosome pathway, and they are related to vitellogenin hydrolysis. Additionally, we found that myosin heavy chain 67 participated in oocyte excretion. Conclusions We provide the first detailed transcriptome data relating to the ovarian maturation cycle in M. nipponense .

After a Poisson lognormal model was adjusted to our data set, a principal component analysis, sparse network reconstruction, and differential analysis allowed us to assess seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbiota and interactions within this community. Results Around 75% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and to potentially circulate in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia , Spiroplasma , Arsenophonus and Wolbachia . The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota varied over time with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs\xa0commonly found in the environment. Total network analysis revealed a majority of positive partial correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus , evidence for the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks.

Here we show using flow cytometry that sLe x expression on basophils and mast cell progenitors depends on fucosyltransferase 6 ( FUT6 ). Using genetic association data analysis and qPCR, the cell type-specific defect was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FUT6 gene region (tagged by rs17855739 and rs778798), affecting coding sequence and/or expression level of the mRNA. Heterozygous individuals with one functional FUT6 gene harbor a mixed population of sLe x+ and sLe x- basophils, a phenomenon caused by random monoallelic expression (RME). Microfluidic assay demonstrated FUT6 -deficient basophils rolling on E-selectin is severely impaired. FUT6 null alleles carriers exhibit elevated blood basophil counts and a reduced itch sensitivity against insect bites. FUT6 -deficiency thus dampens the basophil-mediated allergic response in the periphery, evident also in lower IgE titers and reduced eosinophil counts. Puan and San Luis et al. find that FUT6, encoding a fucosyltransferase, is required for the “rolling” behavior of certain white blood cells that enables them to move from blood vessels to tissues.

We evaluated our models’ performance on an independent subset of tick images not seen during training. Compared to the ResNet-50 model, the small shallow custom-built model had higher training (99.7%) and validation (99.1%) accuracies. When tested with new tick image data, the shallow custom-built model yielded higher mean prediction accuracy (80%), greater confidence of true detection (88.7%) and lower mean response time (3.64\xa0s). These results demonstrate that, with limited data size for model training, a simple shallow custom-built CNN model has great prospects for use in the classification of common hard ticks present in anthropic areas from northeastern USA.']","['Omodior, Oghenekaro, [Saeedpour-Parizi, Mohammad R.], [Rahman, Md.

"['We studied a group of tick-associated viruses with characteristics of members of the family Iflaviridae , a family of viruses frequently found in arthropods. Our aim was to gain insight into the evolutionary dynamics of this group of viruses, which may be linked to the biology of ticks. We explored assembled RNA-Seq data sets for different species of ticks. We identified members of five different iflavirus species, four of them novel, and discovered nine new genome sequences, including variants. Five variants represented a virus species associated with Ixodes ricinus . Unexpectedly, a sequence found in the Ixodes scapularis cell line ISE6 was nearly identical to the sequences of\xa0 I. ricinus variants, suggesting a contamination of this cell line by I. ricinus material. Analysing patterns of substitutions between these variants, we detected a strong excess of synonymous mutations, suggesting evolution under strong positive selection. The phylogenies of the viruses and of their tick hosts were not congruent, suggesting recurrent host changes across tick genera during their evolution. Overall, our work constitutes a step in the understanding of the interactions between this family of viruses and ticks.']","['Daveu, Romain, [Hervet, Caroline], [Sigrist, Louane], [Sassera, Davide], [Jex, Aaron], [Labadie, Karine], [Aury, Jean-Marc], [Plantard, Olivier], [Rispe, Claude]']",['10.1007/s00705-021-05060-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05060-8'],[''],['Sequence diversity and evolution of a group of iflaviruses associated with ticks']
"['Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m 2 ) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m 2 ) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.']","['Hansford, Kayleigh M., [McGinley, Liz], [Wilkinson, Samantha], [Gillingham, Emma L.], [Cull, Ben], [Gandy, Sara], [Carter, Daniel P.], [Vaux, Alexander G.

In this study, we set out to evaluate and confirm the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to identify different species of ticks collected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and preserved in 70% ethanol. A total of 575 ticks, of which 530 were collected from domestic pigs and 45 from wild animals, were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis to evaluate the intraspecies reproducibility and interspecies specificity of MS profiles obtained from the different species. Morphologically, the ticks belonged to seven different species, namely Rhipicephalus complanatus , Rhipicephalus congolensis , Haemaphysalis muhsamae , Ixodes cumulatimpunctatus , Amblyomma exornatum , Amblyomma compressum and an unidentified Rhipicephalus sp.

The remaining good quality spectra were then queried against the upgraded MALDI-TOF MS database, showing that 100% were in agreement with the morphological identification, with logarithmic score values (LSVs) between 1.813 and 2.51.

"['This study proposes a methodology for evaluating market quality of individual stocks in the high-frequency domain (short term) by applying a recommender system that has become ubiquitous in our daily lives, especially when running internet apps. In the first place, it is not easy to evaluate market quality such as the “true” liquidity of individual stocks. In particular, in situations where liquidity for a short-time period is to be evaluated using high-frequency data, the lack of observations can become severe for numerous stocks. Since stocks that have exhibited similar behavior in the past are expected to perform so in the future as well, one can expect that collaborative filtering, which is nowadays the main approach of recommender systems, can work effectively for the market quality measure “estimation” problem for stocks. However, in some occasions, “standard-type” collaborative filtering methods may not work well, especially when data sparsity (or scarcity) is severe. Specifically, in this paper we adopt a regression-based latent factor model (RLFM), a “hybrid-type” collaborative filtering proposed by Agarwal and Chen (Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD’09), 2009). It has a hierarchical linear structure designed to address the so-called “cold-start problem” in the recommender systems literature. In this study, we take on liquidity and volatility as market quality measures. The liquidity measure used in this paper is the inverse limit order book slope proposed by Deuskar and Johnson (Rev Financial Stud 24(3):721–753, 2011). For volatility, we adopt the realized volatility based on tick-by-tick mid-quote prices. To investigate the effectiveness of the method in consideration, empirical analysis was performed using high-frequency limit-order book data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The data period is the first 3\xa0months of the year 2019, with which regularly-spaced 5-min aggregate datasets were formed. The explanatory variables in the regression term are six variables related to observed market activities of individual stocks such as logarithmic return and share volume, three variables related to the static attributes of individual stocks such as whether it is an ingredient of the Nikkei 225 index, and the industry category it belongs to. There are also time polynomial terms up to the order of 6 to capture the average movements of the whole market along the time axis. As a result of the empirical analysis, various characteristics that characterize market quality were identified from the estimated regression coefficients obtained by fitting the RLFM model to the training dataset. The results suggest that our approach is robust to the degree of sparsity (or scarcity) and flexible enough to deal with various data environments. There was room for improvement of the methodology in terms of prediction accuracy.']","['Hayashi, Takaki, [Takahashi, Makoto]']",['10.1007/s42081-021-00116-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42081-021-00116-0'],[''],['On the evaluation of intraday market quality in the limit-order book markets: a collaborative filtering approach']
"['Purpose This study explores healthcare professionals (HCPs)’ perception and current management of sleep disturbance (SD) in people with malignant brain tumours and their caregivers. We aimed to identify barriers to effective management of SD in neuro-oncology care. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 HCPs involved in neuro-oncology care. The study was underpinned by the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model within the Behavioural Change Wheel (BCW) guiding topic selection for the exploration of underlying processes of HCPs’ behaviours and care decisions for SD management. Data were analysed thematically using a framework synthesis, and subsequently mapped onto the BCW to identify barriers for effective management and recommend potential interventions. Results We identified four themes: HCPs’ clinical opinions about SD, the current practice of SD management in neuro-oncology clinics, gaps in the current practice, and suggested areas for improvements. HCPs perceived SD as a prevalent yet secondary issue of low priority in neuro-oncology care. SD was unrecognised, and inadequately managed in usual clinical settings. Interventional options included modifying the use of corticosteroids or prescribing sedatives. When mapped onto the BCW, themes identified main barriers as a lack of awareness among HCPs about SD warranting care, due to the absence of screening tools and limited knowledge and resources for therapeutic interventions. Conclusions Multidisciplinary HCPs need training in the routine use of appropriate sleep assessment tools, and access to clear management pathways. More professional resources are needed to educate staff in implementing appropriate interventions for people with malignant brain tumours who are experiencing SD.']","['Jeon, Megan S., [Agar, Meera R.], [Koh, Eng-Siew], [Nowak, Anna K.], [Hovey, Elizabeth J.], [Dhillon, Haryana M..]']",['10.1007/s00520-020-05970-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05970-4'],[''],['Barriers to managing sleep disturbance in people with malignant brain tumours and their caregivers: a qualitative analysis of healthcare professionals’ perception']

"['Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

"['In this article, I deal with the notion of ‘academic identity’ holistically, seeking to bring together the teacher and researcher roles of academics in the neoliberal university. The article begins from the perspective of early-career academics who occupy the majority of fixed-term, teaching-only contracts in Higher Education, arguing that such casualisation of academic labour entrenches the role of the academic as Homo economicus . Drawing on the work of Foucault, I demonstrate how a neoliberal governmentality is now not only exerted upon academics from without, but increasingly they are subjecting themselves to the logic of efficiency and effectiveness too. The neoliberal governmentality of the university thus influences and shapes academic subjectivities, such that what it means to be an academic is confined to this marketised logic. Despite the pressures placed on academics to ‘produce’ measurable outputs and demonstrate their impact, I argue that moving beyond Homo economicus is possible, arguing instead for a re-claiming of ‘the academic’ as Homo academicus . The idea of Homo academicus can only be supported when three conditions are present: collegiality is afforded greater importance than competition; the discourses of ‘productivity’ and performativity are balanced against simply ‘doing good work well’ (Pirrie in Virtue and the quiet art of scholarship, Routledge, London, 2019 ), and; academics are mindful to practice the ‘quieter’ intellectual virtues, including the virtue of ‘unknowing’ (Smith in J Philos Educ 50:272–284, 2016 ).']","['Skea, Claire']",['10.1007/s11217-021-09768-7'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11217-021-09768-7'],[''],['Emerging Neoliberal Academic Identities: Looking Beyond Homo economicus']

"['More than 800 million people live in proximity to active volcanoes and could be directly impacted by potential eruptions. Mitigation of future volcanic hazards requires adequate warning of a pending eruption, which, in turn, requires detailed understanding of the fundamental processes driving volcanic activity. In this Review, we discuss the processes leading up to volcanic eruptions, by following the journey of magma from crustal storage zones to the surface. Magma reservoirs can feed volcanic eruptions if they contain sufficiently hot and mobile magma and are able to supply sufficient energy for the magma to reach the surface. Young volcanic plumbing systems favour volcanic activity, whereas storage becomes more likely in mature volcanic systems with large reservoirs (hundreds of cubic kilometres). Anticipating volcanic activity requires a multidisciplinary approach, as real-time monitoring and geophysical surveys must be combined with petrology and the eruptive history to understand the temporal evolution of volcanic systems over geological timescales. Numerical modelling serves to link different observational timescales, and the inversion of data sets with physics-based statistical approaches is a promising way forward to advance our understanding of the processes controlling recurrence rate and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. Anticipating the timing, style and size of volcanic eruptions is essential for hazard mitigation. This Review discusses the accumulation and evolution of magma storage regions, the processes that trigger magma reservoir failure and the ascent of magma through the crust. The thermal evolution of magmatic systems influences the physical properties of magma and the rocks surrounding the volcanic plumbing system, which, over the long term, favours magma storage over eruption. Magma recharge is the primary driver of magma reservoir pressurization and destabilization. Second boiling can trigger reservoir failure, although it is less likely to cause repeated eruptions. Only when volcanoes are in a critical state (close to eruption), small variations of stress or rock strength caused by external phenomena can help to initiate a volcanic eruption. Magma can become arrested on its way to the Earth’s surface because a lack of pressure or insufficient volume do not allow the magma to overcome stress barriers.']","['Caricchi, Luca, [Townsend, Meredith], [Rivalta, Eleonora], [Namiki, Atsuko]']",['10.1038/s43017-021-00174-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43017-021-00174-8'],[''],['The build-up and triggers of volcanic eruptions']

"['The use of genetic markers in the context of conservation is largely being outcompeted by whole-genome data. Comparative studies between the two are sparse, and the knowledge about potential effects of this methodology shift is limited. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing data to assess the genetic status of peripheral populations of the wels catfish ( Silurus glanis ), and discuss the results in light of a recent microsatellite study of the same populations. The Swedish populations of the wels catfish have suffered from severe declines during the last centuries and persists in only a few isolated water systems. Fragmented populations generally are at greater risk of extinction, for example due to loss of genetic diversity, and may thus require conservation actions. We sequenced individuals from the three remaining native populations (Båven, Emån, and Möckeln) and one reintroduced population of admixed origin (Helge å), and found that genetic diversity was highest in Emån but low overall, with strong differentiation among the populations. No signature of recent inbreeding was found, but a considerable number of short runs of homozygosity were present in all populations, likely linked to historically small population sizes and bottleneck events. Genetic substructure within any of the native populations was at best weak. Individuals from the admixed population Helge å shared most genetic ancestry with the Båven population (72%). Our results are largely in agreement with the microsatellite study, and stresses the need to protect these isolated populations at the northern edge of the distribution of the species.']","['Jensen, Axel, [Lillie, Mette], [Bergström, Kristofer], [Larsson, Per], [Höglund, Jacob]']",['10.1038/s41437-021-00438-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41437-021-00438-5'],[''],"['Whole genome sequencing reveals high differentiation, low levels of genetic diversity and short runs of homozygosity among Swedish wels catfish']"
"['The threshold concept framework is a key contemporary theory in pedagogy. The core idea is that ‘threshold concepts’ are distinctively ‘troublesome’ for students and act as gatekeepers to their disciplines. No doubt the theory is compelling because there is surely something right about this. Student difficulty with conceptual material is familiar to all teaching practitioners. Furthermore, to avoid rote levels of understanding, mastery of discipline-specific conceptual material is key. However, TCF has struggled to articulate key dimensions of its theory: it is without a methodology for identifying threshold concepts. It has also faltered in explaining how student difficulty is a function of difficulties endemic to the concepts, rather than as a contingent phenomenon about individual students. I offer a novel way to think about identifying threshold concepts, and for theorising student difficulties which may arise from those concepts. I argue that there is an ‘existential’ kind of certainty which acts as a framework within which epistemic activities take place. Disciplines which theorise concepts in ways that clash with students’ existential certainties are candidates for threshold concepts and may generate ‘objective’ difficulties for students. As much as I think theorising existential certainty helps TCF overcome theoretical challenges, it would require revisions to the way that it is currently being theorised and applied. I also believe that even without attachments to TCF, ‘existential certainty’ is a real phenomenon, shaping the very possibilities of student experience, and which any pedagogical theory should be aware of.']","['Stopford, Richard']",['10.1007/s10734-020-00628-w'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-020-00628-w'],[''],['Threshold concepts and certainty: a critical analysis of ‘troublesomeness’']
"['Background Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that play a pivotal role in the transmission of various pathogens to humans and animals. In Korea, Haemaphysalis longicornis is the predominant tick species and is recognized as the vector of pathogens causing various diseases such as babesiosis, borreliosis, rickettsiosis, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Methods In this study, the targeted high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed using the state-of-the-art sequencing instrument, iSeq\xa0100, to screen bacterial pathogens in H. longicornis , and the findings were compared with those using conventional PCR with specific primers. Microbiome analyses were performed with EzBioCloud, a commercially available ChunLab bioinformatics cloud platform. ANOVA-Like Differential Expression tool (ALDEx2) was used for differential abundance analysis. Results Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16 out of 37 samples using iSeq\xa0100, and this was confirmed using a PCR assay. In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks. We believe that this approach will aid in large-scale pathogen screening of arthropods to be used in vector-borne disease control programs.

The purpose of this study is to highlight and report the neglected pathogen from bovines in Pakistan. Methods In this study, the pathogen was detected initially based on microscopy, followed by the molecular confirmation and phylogenetic analysis of the pathogen from bovines from south Punjab, Pakistan. The hematological parameters were also assessed in Ehrlichia positive and negative animals. The information of different disease determinants was analyzed by a logistic regression model on SPSS. Results The study has reported an 11.98% (23/192) prevalence of Ehrlichiosis from bovines. The prevalence was slightly more in cattle (13.5%) as compared to the buffaloes (10.4%). The previous tick’s history and tick control methods were proved to be the key factors with the occurrence of the disease. The isolates from Pakistan Ehrlichia spp. Pakistan/31, 36, and 8 clustered with the isolates from the USA, Nicaraguan, France, South Africa, and Uganda.

Methods A 5-year prospective study on hospital-based incidence and clinico-pathological changes associated with naturally occurring trypanosomosis in dogs of Mizoram was carried out during the study period from April, 2015 to March, 2020. Trypanosoma evansi infection was confirmed by microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Non-infected clinically healthy dogs ( n \u2009=\u20096) served as control. Blood samples were collected to study the haemogram and serum samples were used for the evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and oxidant-antioxidant parameters . Results During the study period, an overall incidence of 0.25% was recorded for trypanosomosis in dogs. The most consistent clinical findings noticed were anorexia/inappetence, pyrexia, depression/lethargy, pale mucous membrane, dehydration and lymphadenomegaly. Anaemia, granulocytopenia, lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia were the major findings noticed in trypanosomosis affected dogs. The profile of vital organ function revealed that the mean values of total protein, albumin and random blood glucose were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower, whereas the mean values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher in dogs affected with trypanosomosis. The mean value of lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) was significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) higher, whereas the mean values of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant activity (TAOA) were significantly ( P \u2009<\u20090.05) lower in trypanosomosis affected dogs. When total erythrocyte count (TEC) was correlated with LPO ( r \u2009=\u2009−\xa00.631, P \u2009<\u20090.05), a negative correlation was found, while in case of GSH ( r \u2009=\u20090.757, P \u2009<\u20090.05), SOD ( r \u2009=\u20090.767, P \u2009<\u20090.05) and TAOA ( r \u2009=\u20090.713, P \u2009<\u20090.05), it was positively correlated. Conclusion A negative correlation of TEC count with LPO, while a positive correlation with GSH, SOD and TAOA signify the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of anaemia induced by T. evansi infection in dogs. The present study findings might be helpful to clinicians when treating clinical cases of this kind.

Here, we reveal that pathogen spreading from arthropods to the mammalian host is multifaceted. Extracellular vesicles from Ixodes scapularis enable tick feeding and promote infection of the mildly virulent rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum through the SNARE proteins Vamp33 and Synaptobrevin 2 and dendritic epidermal T cells. However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases.

"['Purpose This study aimed to analyze the frequency of piroplasmids in the blood of dogs in Rio de Janeiro, compare the performance of microscopic techniques, assess the risk factors associated with infections and also molecularly and morphologically characterize the piroplasmids identified. Methods In all, 407 blood samples were collected from dogs between 2018 and 2019. These were subjected to microscopic parasitological techniques for thin and thick smears, stained with Giemsa and using a rapid staining kit. The slides were read under an optical microscope and the protozoa were characterized morphometrically. In addition, the blood samples were subjected to molecular characterization for diagnosing piroplasmid species using primers that amplified the gene 18S rRNA. Results Piroplasmids were detected in 38 (9.3%) samples. Of these, 33 samples presented nucleotide sequences compatible with Babesia vogeli. Most of the positive samples were young, male, defined breeds dogs that had been attended in clinics in São Gonçalo city. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the hematological alterations more observed in positive samples, but positive samples without alterations were also detected. The sex was the only variable that showed statistical differences. Males dogs being more often infected than females ( p \u2009<\u20090.05). The microscope slides mostly showed piriform and oval merozoites measuring greater than 2.5\xa0µm in length, which were compatible with B. vogeli .

"['Background The present study was aimed at establishing the prevalence, epidemiology and molecular characterization of major haemoprotozoons ( Babesia and Theileria ) and rickettsia ( Anaplasma ) of cattle in Jammu region (North India) using microscopy and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Hematology, microscopy and PCR based prevalence studies were undertaken with 278 whole blood samples from cattle. Molecular prevalence studies were followed by genetic characterization of the isolates of Babesia , Anaplasma and Theileria spp. based on 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA and Tams1 gene, respectively. The data related to metrology and epidemiological variables like temperature, rainfall, season, age and type of livestock rearing was analyzed and correlated with occurrence of disease by statistical methods. Results The prevalence based on microscopy was 12.9% (36/278) whereas PCR recorded 30.22% (84/278) animals positive for haemoparasitic infections. All the samples found positive by microscopy were also recorded positive by PCR. Thus the study revealed prevalence of Babesia bigemina , Anaplasma marginale and Theileria annulata to be 9.7, 16.5 and 0.7% respectively. The metrological and epidemiological variables made inroads for the propagation of vector ticks and occurrence of infection. Haematological alterations predominantly related to decrease in haemoglobin, red blood cell count and packed cell volume were evident in diseased animals and collaterally affected the productivity. Further the genetic characterization of Babesia bigemina . (MN566925.1, MN567603, MN566924.1), Anaplasma marginale . (MH733242.1, MN567602.1) and Theileria annulata (MT113479) provided a representative data of the isolates circulating in the region and their proximity with available sequences across the world.

Methods A large dataset ( n \u2009=\u200921,992) of serological test results for selected TBPs in three macro areas in Italy was analysed using a Chi-square test to evaluate the associations between the categorical factors (i.e. macro area, region, year, sex and age) and a standard logistic regression model (significance set at P \u2009=\u20090.05). Serological data were presented as annual and cumulative prevalence, and distribution maps of cumulative positive cases for TBPs were generated. Results Of the tested serum samples, 86.9% originated from northern (43.9%) and central (43%) Italy. The majority of the tests was requested for the diagnosis of E. canis (47%; n \u2009=\u200910,334), followed by Rickettsia spp. (35.1%; n \u2009=\u20097725), B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (11.6%; n \u2009=\u20092560) and Anaplasma spp. (6.2%; n \u2009=\u20091373). The highest serological exposure was recorded for B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (83.5%), followed by Rickettsia spp. (64.9%), Anaplasma spp. (39.8%) and E. canis (28.7%). The highest number of cumulative cases of Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was recorded in samples from Tuscany, central Italy. Rickettsia spp. was more prevalent in the south and on the islands, particularly in dogs on Sicily older than 6\xa0years, whereas Anaplasma spp. was more prevalent in the north and E. canis more prevalent in the south and on the islands. Conclusions The results of this study highlight the high seroprevalence and wide distribution of the four TBPs in dogs with clinically suspected CVBDs from the studied regions of Italy. The very high seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) exemplifies a limitation of this study, given the use of clinically suspect dogs and the possibility of cross-reactions when using serological tests. The present research provides updated and illustrative information on the seroprevalence and distribution of four key TBPs, and advocates for integrative control strategies for their prevention.

"['Small mammals are important reservoirs of multiple pathogens transmittable to humans. Rodent populations are highly dynamic, passing through multiannual cycles with densities changing in several orders of magnitude. Such variable pools of hosts shape the intensity of pathogen spread among the animals and risks of spillover to humans. We describe such dynamic system within a sample set of 13 small mammal species and six potentially zoonotic pathogens (bacteria Anaplasma, Rickettsia , Leptospira, Borrelia, Bartonella , and protist Babesia ) present in surroundings of a small village in south-eastern part of the Czech Republic. This article presents results of a six-year-long study at the site. The observed prevalence of the selected pathogens varied greatly among years and host species. The dominant rodents ( Apodemus sp., Apodemus agrarius and Myodes glareolus ) harboured all tested pathogens and multi-infections were not rare – we found up to four pathogens in some individuals. We observed surge in Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. prevalence following the overall rodent population increase in 2014 and 2019, with A. agrarius and Microtus arvalis being the most infected species. Rickettsia sp. prevalence reached 24\u2009% in the shrew Crocidura suaveolens , thus this potential neglected reservoir host deserves further attention.']","['Balážová, Alena, [Nosková, Eva], [Široký, Pavel], [Durrant, Christopher], [Baláž, Vojtech]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00797-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00797-8'],[''],['Diversity and dynamics of zoonotic pathogens within a local community of small mammals']

"['Purpose of Review International and domestic travelers may acquire a wide variety of infectious diseases transmitted by exposure to insects. Exposure to ticks may be associated with systemic infections clinically suspected through skin and soft tissue manifestations along with fever, myalgia, headache, and other related symptoms. Cutaneous lesions may include eschars at the site of initial contact, maculopapular rashes, or others as the result of systemic dissemination of viral, Rickettsial, parasitic, and protozoan infections acquired by exposure to different types of ticks. Recent findings Ticks represent the second most common global vector of transmission of infectious diseases to humans after mosquitoes. In some endemic regions, ticks are the most important vector of transmission of a great variety of infectious pathogens including protozoan ( Babesia spp.), viral ( Coltivirus ), rickettsia, and bacterial infections ( Francisella tularensis ). With increasing international travel, different tick-borne diseases continue to emerge and being identified. Summary Identifying the cutaneous signs associated with tick-borne diseases is crucial to clinically suspect the diagnosis of a specific tick-borne illness. Minimizing the exposure to ticks during domestic or international travel represents the most important intervention to reducing the risk of tick-borne illnesses.']","['Cordero, Jose Henao, [Shepard, Zachary], [Schultz, Jonathan], [Scherrer, Sara], [Henao-Martinez, Andres F.], [Saifee, Jessica], [Franco-Paredes, Carlos], [Suarez, Jose Antonio], [Agudelo-Higuita, Nelson]']",['10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00230-9'],[''],['Dermatologic Manifestations of Tick-borne Diseases in Travelers']
"['Brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, an important ectoparasite transmitting several pathogens, is the most common tick species infesting dogs. Control of ticks being central to the control of fatal tick-borne diseases, this study attempted to assess the susceptibility/resistance of brown dog ticks to synthetic pyrethroids, the commonly used acaricides against ticks. Larval packet assay revealed 60% of isolates tested to be resistant and tolerant to deltamethrin as per the resistance factor that ranged from 1 to 53.7. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplified product of domain II S4-5 linker of sodium channel gene in R. sanguineus revealed novel polymorphisms, viz., C190A, G215T and T270C. In domain III S6 region of the gene, a T2134C mutation was observed. Genotyping with allele-specific PCR targeting domain II S4-5 linker region using single larvae revealed that most R. sanguineus larvae in the study population were homozygous resistant (RR) genotypes, followed by heterozygous (RS) and homozygous susceptible (SS) genotypes. A higher proportion of RS genotypes was also observed in domain III S6 region. This first report of genotyping of Indian R. sanguineus to analyse synthetic pyrethroid resistance highlights the need to devise alternate control strategies to reduce the brown dog tick population.']","['Amrutha, Anand, [Bindu, Lakshmanan], [Kajal, T.

"['Ticks will diminish productivity among farm animals and transmit zoonotic diseases. We conducted a study to identify tick species infesting slaughter bulls from Adama City and to screen them for tick-borne pathogens. In 2016, 291 ticks were collected from 37 bulls in Adama, which were ready for slaughter. Ticks were identified morphologically. Total genomic DNA was extracted from ticks and used to test for Rickettsia spp. with real-time PCR. Species identification was done by phylogenetic analysis using sequencing that targeted the 23S-5S intergenic spacer region and ompA genes. Four tick species from two genera, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus , were identified. Amblyomma cohaerens was the dominant species (n\u2009=\u2009241, 82.8%), followed by Amblyomma variegatum (n\u2009=\u200922, 7.5%), Rhipicephalus pulchellus (n\u2009=\u200919, 6.5%), and Rhipicephalus decoloratus (n\u2009=\u20099, 3.0%).

"['Introduction Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM) remains a high-risk clinical condition, and many patients require emergency department (ED) management for complications and stabilization. Objective This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of CM. Discussion This review evaluates the diagnosis, management, and empiric treatment of suspected CM in the ED. CM can easily evade diagnosis with a subacute presentation, and should be considered in any patient with a headache, neurological deficit, or who is immunocompromised. As a definitive diagnosis of CM will not be made in the ED, management of a patient with suspected CM includes prompt diagnostic testing and initiation of empiric treatment. Multiple types of newer Cryptococcal antigen tests provide high sensitivity and specificity both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients should be treated empirically for bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis, specifically with amphotericin B and flucytosine for presumed CM. Additionally, appropriate resuscitation and supportive care, including advanced airway management, management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), antipyretics, intravenous fluids, and isolation, should be initiated. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be initiated in the ED for those found or known to be HIV-positive for risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Conclusions CM remains a rare clinical presentation, but carries significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these patients while evaluating for other diseases and complications. Early consultation with an infectious disease specialist is imperative, as is initiating symptomatic care.']","['Fisher, Kathryn Marie, [Montrief, Tim], [Ramzy, Mark], [Koyfman, Alex], [Long, Brit]']",['10.1007/s11739-020-02619-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02619-2'],[''],['Cryptococcal meningitis: a review for emergency clinicians']

"['Background Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato – the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study ‘Ticking on Pandora’s Box’ has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. Methods The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases – individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease – and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis.

"['Background Canine babesiosis and anaplasmosis, caused by Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , respectively, are significant tick-borne diseases in Baltic countries. Both diseases can be diagnosed on the basis of clinicopathological findings, by direct pathogen detection in blood smears or by indirect pathogen detection; however, because of high selectivity and specificity, molecular methods may be advantageous. The goal of this study was to develop a duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples. Methods Sequence-based polymorphism analysis of genes encoding B. canis -specific merozoite surface protein Bc28.1 ( Bc28.1 ) and A. phagocytophilum malate dehydrogenase ( mdh ) was performed on pathogen isolates present in Latvian domestic dogs. The obtained results were used to design a species-specific duplex RT-PCR assay. Results The presence of three B. canis Bc28.1 gene sequence types was revealed in canine samples with a nonuniform geographical distribution, and two types of A. phagocytophilum mdh genes were detected. The novel duplex RT-PCR assay provided correct classification of samples positive and negative for B. canis and A. phagocytophilum . The analytical sensitivity of this assay was ten gene copies/ reaction for both pathogens. Conclusions A novel duplex RT-PCR molecular method was developed for the detection of B. canis and A. phagocytophilum in canine clinical samples.

"['Background The study objective was to examine cat owner ectoparasiticide purchases in the United States and estimate the impact of purchase gaps on timely ectoparasite protection administration. These purchase gaps lead to periods of time when cats are unprotected from ectoparasites. Methods Ectoparasiticide purchase transactions for individual cats from 671 U.S. veterinary clinics from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019 were evaluated to determine time “gaps” between doses of ectoparasiticides purchased in a defined 12-month period. Ectoparasiticides examined were topically applied products that contained fluralaner, fipronil/(S)-methoprene/pyriproxyfen, imidacloprid/pyriproxyfen or selamectin as active ingredients. The duration of protection following administration of one dose was 8–12 weeks for the fluralaner-containing product and one month for the other products. Results Ectoparasiticide purchase records were obtained from 114,853 cat owners and analysis found that most owners bought\u2009≤\u20096 months of protection during the year, with 61–75% (depending on the product) purchasing just 1–3 months of protection. The size of the average purchase gap was determined for all dose combinations out to 12 months of protection (5–7 doses for fluralaner and 12 doses for the other three products dosed monthly. The largest gaps occurred between the first and second doses and the second and third doses. Average purchase gaps for the four different products between doses 1 and 2 ranged from 11.2 to 13.9 weeks and between doses 2 and 3 ranged from 7.7 to 12.2 weeks. The fraction of purchases separated by gaps and the average length of the gap tended to decrease with increasing number of doses purchased. Owners purchasing the 8 to 12-week duration product containing fluralaner provided ectoparasite protection (“doses plus gap period”) for a larger proportion of each 2-dose period compared with owners purchasing products administered monthly. Conclusions When cat owners purchase flea and tick medication, gaps between subsequent purchases reduces the proportion of time ectoparasite protection can be provided. The duration of the gap between doses has an impact on the effectiveness of flea/tick medication because it inserts a period without flea and tick protection between doses of flea and tick medication. The gaps between purchases were shorter and the period of ectoparasite protection was larger for owners purchasing a 12-week product than for owners purchasing a monthly product.']","['Lavan, Robert, [Normile, Dorothy], [Husain, Imran], [Singh, Amita], [Heaney, Kathleen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04768-5'],[''],['Analysis of gaps in feline ectoparasiticide purchases from veterinary clinics in the United States']

"['Forests in eastern North America are experiencing high densities of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) and encroachment by invasive plants, both of which threaten native biodiversity. We review the literature on deer and invasive plant impacts focusing on studies that simultaneously evaluate the consequences of both. Deer have more frequent and more consistently negative effects than invasive plants. Widespread deer impacts now threaten many native plant species through much of their range. In contrast, invasive plant effects currently remain more localized and/or of smaller extent within forests. Deer impacts are also cumulative, hitting preferred plant species especially hard as they decline in density. This generates difficult-to-reverse legacy effects. Invasive plant effects, in contrast, tend to be more diffuse and may be more readily reversed. High deer populations also shift physical and chemical conditions in soils promoting “invasion cascades” involving non-native earthworms and certain introduced plants. Removing invasive plants without reducing deer populations can increase deer impacts on native species. Management should be integrated to address both deer and invasive plants. To safeguard and restore native biota when resources are limited, however, it may be most effective for managers to first reduce deer populations before investing in efforts to reduce invasive populations (except when invasions are at an early stage). We should rethink and reform traditional approaches to managing deer so that we can better integrate land vegetation with wildlife management to achieve broad public objectives. Interacting effects of high ungulate populations and invasive plants deserve further study to determine whether similar recommendations apply to other regions.']","['Gorchov, David L., [Blossey, Bernd], [Averill, Kristine M.], [Dávalos, Andrea], [Heberling, J.

Only a few\xa0 published reports are avaliable\xa0on the\xa0prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Aim and objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000–2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Methods A systematic review of articles\xa0published in English language (since 2000–2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. Results The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40%, 21.18%, 26.78%, and 11.62%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11% (76/360) in goats, and 40% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88% (104/348) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), in goats was 29.88% (25/60) with slightly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.031%), and in both sheep and goats were 7% (21/300) with highly significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.001), 4.51% (31/687) in goats with significant differences ( P \u2009<\u20090.133), and 25% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them ( P \u2009<\u20090.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63% (149/800) and 4.63% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56%) followed by ELISA (38.38%), PCR (12.56%), and PCR-RLB (3.48%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan. Conclusion Based on our results, among tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis had the highest prevalence rate in sheep and goats.

"['Background Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) represent a significant economic burden to cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria. However, in the northern part of this country, where the largest livestock population resides, little is known about the contemporary diversity of ticks and TBPs. This area is particularly vulnerable to climate change, undergoing marked transformation of habitat and associated flora and fauna that is also likely to include ticks. This study aimed to document the occurrence of tick species and Apicomplexan TBPs in cattle from north-western Nigeria. Methods In 2017, ticks were collected from cattle in Zamfara and Sokoto States and identified morphologically. Additionally, a subset of ticks was screened molecularly for the detection of apicomplexan DNA. Results A total of 494 adult ticks were collected from 80 cattle in Zamfara and 65 cattle in Sokoto State. Nine tick species were encountered, among which the presence of one, Hyalomma turanicum , had not previously been recorded in Nigeria. Hyalomma rufipes was the most prevalent tick infesting cattle in Zamfara State (76%), while Hyalomma dromedarii was the most prevalent in Sokoto State (44%), confirming the widespread transfer of this species from camels onto livestock and its adaptation to cattle in the region. Of 159 ticks screened, 2 out of 54 (3.7%) from Zamfara State and 29 out of 105 (27.6%) from Sokoto State harboured DNA of Theileria annulata , the agent of tropical theileriosis. Conclusions This study confirms the presence of a broad diversity of tick species in cattle from north-western Nigeria, providing the first locality records for Zamfara State. The occurrence of H. turanicum indicates a distribution of this tick beyond northern Africa. This study provides the first report for T. annulata in Nigerian ticks. Given its enormous burden on livestock farming in north Africa and across Asia, further investigations are needed to better understand its epidemiology, vector transmission and potential clinical significance in cattle from northern Nigeria and neighbouring Sahelian countries.']","['Mamman, Adamu Haruna, [Lorusso, Vincenzo], [Adam, Babagana Mohammed], [Dogo, Goni Abraham], [Bown, Kevin J.], [Birtles, Richard J.]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04731-4'],[''],['First report of Theileria annulata in Nigeria: Findings from cattle ticks in Zamfara and Sokoto States']
"['In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India.

"['Present-day diagnostic tools and technologies for canine diseases and other vector-borne parasitic diseases hardly meet the requirements of an efficient and rapid diagnostic tool, which can be suitable for use at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique has been always a method of choice in the development and validation of quick, precise, and sensitive diagnostic assays for pathogen detection and to reorganize point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostics. In this study, we have demonstrated an efficient detection system for parasitic vector-borne pathogens like Ehrlichia canis and Hepatozoon canis by linking the LAMP assay to a smartphone via a simple, inexpensive, and a portable “LAMP box,” All the components of the LAMP box were connected to each other wirelessly. This LAMP box was made up of an isothermal heating pad mounted below an aluminum base which served as a platform for the reaction tubes and LAMP assay. The entire setup could be connected to a smartphone via an inbuilt Wi-Fi that allowed the user to establish the connection to control the LAMP box. A 5 V USB power source was used as a power supply. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was estimated to be up to 10 −6 dilution limit using the amplified, purified, and quantified specific DNA templates.

"['Purpose Genotyping of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus for polymorphisms in deltamethrin-resistant loci of sodium channel gene by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) . Methods Adult R. (B.) microplus ticks were collected from naturally infested cattle in Kerala. The larval packet test (LPT) was performed with deltamethrin and dose response data were analysed by probit method. Adult and larval tick DNA were amplified by PCR and later sequenced to identify mutations, if any, in the domain II S4-5 linker and domain III S6 regions in para voltage-gated sodium channel gene, at loci that were previously documented to be associated with deltamethrin resistance. Allele-specific PCR was performed for the amplification of target gene locus (C190A and T2134C) to genotype 1000 larvae each, at these loci. Genotype frequency was statistically analysed by Chi-square test. Results Bioassay using LPT revealed that LC 50 and LC 95 values of all the R. (B.) microplus isolates in this study were more than double the reported values of reference susceptible strain. Sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons of domain II S4-5 linker of voltage-gated sodium channel gene revealed C190A mutation, A271G mutation as well as A–G mutation at 217th position. AS-PCR done to genotype C190A mutations revealed a frequency of 6%, 15% and 64%, respectively for homozygous-susceptible (SS), heterozygous (RS) and homozygous-resistant (RR) genotypes. In domain III S6 region of the gene, C2121T and A2102T mutations were observed. AS-PCR to genotype the previously reported T2134C mutation revealed 100% SS genotype in R.

"['Purpose Dirofilaria immitis , a mosquito-borne nematode that primarily infects dogs, can equally infect cats. Although there have been numerous studies on canine heartworm prevalence in Brazil, there have been few studies on feline infections. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are both life-threatening retroviruses transmitted directly between cats. Infections with Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. are highly prevalent among dogs in Brazil, with Rhipicephalus sanguineus being the main vector for both bacteria. This study aimed to gather information on these infections among dogs and cats in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro by performing rapid point-of-care tests for prophylactic enforcement. Methods Surplus samples of serum or plasma from private laboratories were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (SNAP Feline Triple Test or SNAP 4Dx Plus Test). Results The prevalence of heartworm disease was 7% among dogs and 0.9% among cats, the latter being 12.9% of the former. The prevalence of FIV and FeLV was 4.3 and 11.9%, respectively. Among dogs, the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. was 27.1 and 9.8%, respectively, and Borrelia burgdorferi was not detected.

Repeated exposure of fipronil to cattle ticks, Rhipicephalus microplus and Hyalomma anatolicum might have led to the emergence of acaricide resistance. The objective of this study was to estimate fipronil sensitivity in field ticks collected from 8 different farms of Haryana (India) using FAO recommended larval packet test.

"['Background Blood-feeding arthropods can transmit parasitic, bacterial, or viral pathogens to domestic animals and wildlife. Vector-borne infections are gaining significance because of increasing travel and import of pets from abroad as well as the changing climate in Europe. The main objective of this study was to assess the percentage of cats with positive test results for selected vector-borne pathogens in Germany and explore any possible association of such results with time spent abroad. Methods This retrospective study included test results from cats included in the “Feline Travel Profile” established by the LABOKLIN laboratory at the request of veterinarians in Germany between April 2012 and March 2020. This diagnostic panel includes the direct detection of Hepatozoon spp. and Dirofilaria spp. via PCR as well as indirect detection assays (IFAT) for Ehrlichia spp. and Leishmania spp. The panel was expanded to include an IFAT for Rickettsia spp. from July 2015 onwards. Results A total of 624 cats were tested using the “Feline Travel Profile.” Serum for indirect detection assays was available for all 624 cats; EDTA samples for direct detection methods were available from 618 cats. Positive test results were as follows: Ehrlichia spp. IFAT 73 out of 624 (12%), Leishmania spp. IFAT 22 out of 624 (4%), Hepatozoon spp. PCR 53 out of 618 (9%), Dirofilaria spp. PCR 1 out of 618 cats (0.2%), and Rickettsia spp. IFAT 52 out of 467 cats (11%) tested from July 2015 onwards. Three cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen before 2015. After testing for Rickettsia spp. was included in 2015, 19 cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen ( Rickettsia spp. were involved in 14 out of these 19 cats). Conclusions At least one pathogen could be detected in 175 out of 624 cats (28%) via indirect and/or direct detection methods. Four percent had positive test results for more than one pathogen.

"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an important tick-borne zoonotic agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). In Europe, the Ixodes ticks are the main vector responsible for A. phagocytophilum transmission. A wide range of wild animals is involved in the circulation of this pathogen in the environment. Changes in populations of vertebrates living in different ecosystems impact the ecology of ticks and the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases. In this study, we investigated four species, Western European hedgehog ( Erinaceus europaeus ), northern white-breasted hedgehog ( Erinaceus roumanicus ), Eurasian red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ), and the common blackbird ( Turdus merula ), to describe their role in the circulation of A. phagocytophilum in urban and periurban ecosystems. Ten different tissues were collected from cadavers of the four species, and blood and ear/skin samples from live blackbirds and hedgehogs. Using qPCR, we detected a high rate of A. phagocytophilum : Western European hedgehogs (96.4%), northern white-breasted hedgehogs (92.9%), Eurasian red squirrels (60%), and common blackbirds (33.8%). In the groEL gene, we found nine genotypes belonging to three ecotypes; seven of the genotypes are associated with HGA symptoms. Our findings underline the role of peridomestic animals in the ecology of A. phagocytophilum and indicate that cadavers are an important source of material for monitoring zoonotic pathogens. Concerning the high prevalence rate, all investigated species play an important role in the circulation of A. phagocytophilum in municipal areas; however, hedgehogs present the greatest anaplasmosis risk for humans.

"['Background Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. Methods The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks ( n \u2009=\u20091953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene ( flaB ) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia -positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Conclusions Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases.

"['Background The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis (Neumann) is a well-known vector of numerous pathogens of veterinary and medical importance. Various control strategies, including the use of synthetic pesticides, have been developed to control this tick species. However, demand for effective and safe alternative pesticides is increasing due to the adverse effects associated with the intensive and injudicious use of synthetic pesticides, which include undesirable effects on non-target species and environmental pollution. Hence, the acaricidal activity of the extract and the essential oil of Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) and their major components, and the underlying mechanisms of this activity, were evaluated against unfed larvae and nymphs of H . longicornis . Methods The components of the extract and essential oil of C. cassia were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and their larvicidal and nymphicidal activity were evaluated using the larval and nymphal packet test. The underlying detoxification mechanism was elucidated by targeting in vivo esterase and monooxygenase activity, and the toxicological effect was assessed on non-target Tenebrio molitor and Harmonia axyridis by topical application in open Petri dishes. Results ( E )-cinnamaldehyde was the predominant component of the extract (50.79%) and essential oil (89.95%). The 50% lethal concentration (LC 50 ) for larvae and nymphs treated with the extract was 11.56 and 49.18\xa0mg/mL, respectively. The essential oil, ( E )-cinnamaldehyde and fenvalerate exhibited acaricidal activity, with LC 50 values of 3.81, 3.15, and 0.14\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the larvae, and 21.31, 16.93, and 1.89\xa0mg/mL, respectively, against the nymphs. ( E )-cinnamaldehyde significantly increased esterase and monooxygenase activity in both larvae and nymphs. Unlike fenvalerate, C . cassia essential oil and ( E )-cinnamaldehyde did not cause mortality of T . molitor or H . axyridis adults.

However, extracellular vesicles from the tick Dermacentor andersoni mitigate microbial spreading caused by the lethal pathogen Francisella tularensis . Collectively, we establish that tick extracellular vesicles foster distinct outcomes of bacterial infection and assist in vector feeding by acting on skin immunity. Thus, the biology of arthropods should be taken into consideration when developing strategies to control vector-borne diseases.

"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.']","['Lugassy, Léa, [Amdouni-Boursier, Ludivine], [Alout, Haoues], [Berrebi, Romuald], [Boëte, Christophe], [Boué, Franck], [Boulanger, Nathalie], [Durand, Thierry], [Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel], [Larrat, Sylvain], [Moinet, Marie], [Moulia, Catherine], [Pagès, Nonito], [Plantard, Olivier], [Robert, Vincent], [Livoreil, Barbara]']",['10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4'],[''],['What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?

"['Characterising within-host microbial interactions is essential to understand the drivers that shape these interactions and their consequences for host ecology and evolution. Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed.']","['Cameron, Laura, [Rocque, Rhéa], [Penner, Kailey], [Mauro, Ian]']",['10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10614-1'],[''],"['Public perceptions of Lyme disease and climate change in southern Manitoba, Canada: making a case for strategic decoupling of climate and health messages']"
"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato\xa0(s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2\xa0years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects\xa0models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Results We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2\xa0years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l.\xa0and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Conclusions Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.']","['Bregnard, Cindy, [Rais, Olivier], [Voordouw, Maarten Jeroen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],[''],['Masting by beech trees predicts the risk of Lyme disease']

"['Ticks (Arachnida: Acari) are vectors for pathogens and the biggest threat to animal health. Many Australian ticks are associated with pathogens that impact humans, domestic animals and livestock. However, little is known about the presence or impact of tick-borne pathogens in native Australian wildlife. Wombats are particularly susceptible to the effects of the ectoparasite Sarcoptes scabiei which causes sarcoptic mange, the reason for which is unknown. Factors such as other ectoparasites and their associated pathogens may play a role. A critical understanding of the species of ectoparasites that parasitise wombats and their pathogens, and particularly ticks, is therefore warranted. This review describes the ectoparasites of wombats, pathogens known to be associated with those ectoparasites, and related literature gaps. Pathogens have been isolated in most tick species that typically feed on wombats; however, there are minimal molecular studies to determine the presence of pathogens in any other wombat ectoparasites. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allows us to explore entire microbial communities in ectoparasite samples, allowing fast and accurate identification of potential pathogens in many samples at once. These new techniques have highlighted the diversity and uniqueness of native ticks and their microbiomes, including pathogens of potential medical and veterinary importance.

"['Abstract Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards ( Sceloporus occidentalis ) are a key host to western blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus ). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures, or both. We infested adult males with larval ticks for 7 to 10 days, staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits, for either infested or uninfested males. There was also no effect of tick attachment location and hemoparasite infection on host contest behavior. This is the first demonstration of the impact of I. pacificus parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness. Because I. pacificus rely heavily on these lizards for blood meals and dispersal, these impacts could also influence the abundance of ticks and the pathogens they vector. Significance statement Parasitism frequently impairs host behavior. We investigated the effect of blacklegged tick parasitism on western fence lizard contest behavior using a lab-based manipulation experiment. We demonstrated that tick infestation reduced lizard aggressiveness, which may lead to territory loss and reduced mating opportunities in the wild. We found no evidence that host body size or coloration\xa0are correlated with aggression. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that tick parasitism is costly for lizards, while demonstrating the usefulness of manipulation experiments to understand host-parasite interactions.']","['Lanser, Dylan M., [Vredevoe, Larisa K.], [Kolluru, Gita R.]']",['10.1007/s00265-021-02980-y'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-021-02980-y'],[''],['Tick parasitism impairs contest behavior in the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis)']

"['Borrelia miyamotoi , a bacterium that causes relapsing fever, is found in ixodid ticks throughout the northern hemisphere. The first cases of human infection with B. miyamotoi were identified in 2011. In the eastern USA, blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) become infected by feeding on an infected vertebrate host, or through transovarial transmission. We surveyed B. miyamotoi prevalence in ticks within forested habitats in Dutchess County, New York, and identified possible reservoir hosts. To assess spatial variation in infection, we collected questing nymphal ticks at >\xa0150 sites. To assess temporal variation in infection, we collected questing nymphs for 8 years at a single study site. We collected questing larval ticks from nine plots to estimate the amount of transovarial transmission. To evaluate potential reservoir hosts, we captured 14 species of mammal and bird hosts naturally infested with larval blacklegged ticks and held these hosts in the laboratory until ticks fed to repletion and molted to nymphs. We determined infection for all ticks using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The overall infection prevalence of questing nymphal ticks across all sites was ~\u20091%, but prevalence at individual sites was as high as 9.1%. We detected no significant increase in infection through time. Only 0.4% of questing larval ticks were infected. Ticks having fed as larvae from short-tailed shrews, red squirrels, and opossums tended to have higher infection prevalence than did ticks having fed on other hosts.

The geographic distribution of both arthropod vectors and the pathogens they transmit continues to expand. Methods To describe the current geographic distribution and prevalence of antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi , Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. in dogs, we summarized over 144\xa0million test results from 2013 to 2019, inclusive, by county, state, and region. Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas. Annual reports of human cases of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis were associated with percent positive canine results by state for the three tick-borne disease agents ( R 2 \u2009=\u20090.812, 0.521, and 0.546, respectively). Within endemic areas, percent positive test results for all three tick-borne agents demonstrated evidence of geographic expansion.

"['Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is endemic in twenty-seven European countries, transmitted via the bite of an infected tick. TBEV is the causative agent of one of the most important viral diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). In Germany, 890 human cases were registered between the years 2018–2019. The castor bean tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the TBEV vector with the highest importance in Central Europe, including Germany. Despite the nationwide distribution of this tick species, risk areas of TBEV are largely located in Southern Germany. To increase our understanding of TBEV-tick interactions, we collected ticks from different areas within Germany (Haselmühl/Bavaria, Hanover/Lower Saxony) and infected them via an in vitro feeding system. A TBEV isolate was obtained from an endemic focus in Haselmühl. In two experimental series conducted in 2018 and 2019, ticks sampled in Haselmühl (TBEV focus) showed higher artificial feeding rates, as well as higher TBEV infections rates than ticks from the non-endemic area (Hanover). Other than the tick origin, year and month of the infection experiment as well as co-infection with Borrelia spp., had a significant impact on TBEV Haselmühl infection rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that a specific adaptation of the tick populations to their respective TBEV virus isolates or vice versa, leads to higher TBEV infection rates in those ticks. Furthermore, co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia spp. can lower TBEV infection rates in specific populations.']","['Liebig, Katrin, [Boelke, Mathias], [Grund, Domenic], [Schicht, Sabine], [Springer, Andrea], [Strube, Christina], [Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia], [Dobler, Gerhard], [Jung, Klaus], [Becker, Stefanie]']",['10.1038/s41598-020-71920-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71920-z'],[''],['Tick populations from endemic and non-endemic areas in Germany show differential susceptibility to TBEV']
"['Background The family Labridae made up of 519 species in the world. The functional evolution of the feeding-related jaws leaded to differentiation of species, and the pharyngeal jaw apparatus evolved independently, but evolutionary mechanism still remain unaddressed in wrasses. Mitogenomes data can be used to infer genetic diversification and investigate evolutionary history of wrasses, whereas only eight complete mitogenomes in this family have been sequenced to date. Here, we sequenced the complete mitogenomes of Iniistius trivittatus to investigate genetic differentiation among wrasse species. Results We sequenced the complete mitogenomes of I. trivittatus using a novel PCR strategy. The I. trivittatus mitogenomes is 16,820\u2009bp in length and includes 13 protein -coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a control region. Compared to eight known mitochondrial genome, 2 additional noncoding regions (lengths of 121 and 107\u2009bp), or so-called inserts, are found in the intergenic regions 12S rRNA - tRNA Val - 16S rRNA. The presumed origin of the two rare inserts is from tRNA- related retrotransposons. Compared with cytochrome b gene, the two insert sequences are highly conserved at the intraspecies level, but they showed significant variation and low similarity (<\u200970%) at the interspecies level. The insert events were only observed in I. trivittatus by checking the phylogenetic trees based on the complete mitogenomes of Labrida species. This finding provides evidence that in the mitogenomes, retrotransposon inserts result in intraspecific homoplasmy and interspecific heteroplasmy by natural selection and adaptation to various environments. Conclusions This study found additional mitogenome inserts limited in wrasse species. The rRNA genes with inserts might have experienced a selective pressure for adaptation to feeding modes. Such knowledge can enable a better understanding of molecular mechanism underlying morphological evolution in wrasses.']","['Liu, Dong, [Zhang, Yuanyuan], [Zhang, Ming], [Yang, Jinquan], [Tang, Wenqiao]']",['10.1186/s12862-020-01683-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-020-01683-8'],[''],['Complete mitochondrial genome of Iniistius trivittatus and unique variation in two observed inserts between rRNA and tRNA genes in wrasses']

Up-to-date maps depicting the geographical distribution and climate adaptation of the two Dermacentor species are presented. To investigate the climate adaptation of the two tick species, the georeferenced locations were superimposed on a high-resolution map of the Köppen–Geiger climate classification. The frequency distribution of D. reticulatus under different climates shows two major peaks related to the following climates: warm temperate with precipitation all year round (57%) and boreal with precipitation all year round (40%). The frequency distribution of D. silvarum shows also two major peaks related to boreal climates with precipitation all year round (30%) and boreal winter dry climates (60%). Dermacentor silvarum seems to be rather flexible concerning summer temperatures, which can range from cool to hot.

"['Background To predict the risk of tick-borne disease, it is critical to understand the ecological factors that determine the abundance of ticks. In Europe, the sheep tick ( Ixodes ricinus ) transmits a number of important diseases including Lyme borreliosis. The aim of this long-term study was to determine the abiotic and biotic factors driving the annual\xa0abundance of I. ricinus at a location in Switzerland where Lyme borreliosis is endemic. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004 to 2018), we monitored the abundance of I. ricinus ticks on a monthly basis at three different elevations on Chaumont Mountain in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree\xa0seed production from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically two years after a masting event. We used AIC-based model selection to determine which ecological variables drive annual variation in tick density. Results We found that elevation\xa0site, year, seed production by beech trees two years prior, and mean annual\xa0relative humidity together explained 73.2% of the variation in our annual estimates of nymph density. According to the parameter estimates of our models, (i) the annual density of nymphs almost doubled over the 15-year study period, (ii) changing the beech tree seed production index from very poor mast\xa0(1) to full\xa0mast\xa0(5) increased the abundance of nymphs by 86.2% two years later, and (iii) increasing the field-collected mean\xa0annual\xa0relative humidity from 50.0 to 75.0% decreased the abundance of nymphs by 46.4% in the same year. Climate variables collected in the field were better predictors of tick abundance than those from nearby weather stations indicating the importance of the microhabitat. Conclusions From a public health perspective, the increase in nymph abundance is likely to have increased the risk of tick-borne disease in this region of Switzerland. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that seed production by deciduous trees is a critical driver of the abundance of I. ricinus , and hence the risk of tick-borne disease.']","['Bregnard, Cindy, [Rais, Olivier], [Voordouw, Maarten Jeroen]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04291-z'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04291-z'],[''],['Climate and tree seed production predict the abundance of the European Lyme disease vector over a 15-year period']
"['Background Assessing the burden of rickettsial infections in Ontario, Canada, is challenging since rickettsial infections are not reportable to public health. In the absence of reportable disease data, we assessed the burden of rickettsial infections by examining patient serological data and clinical information. Methods Our retrospective, cross-sectional study included patients who had Rickettsia serological testing ordered by their physician, in Ontario, from 2013 to 2018. We tested sera from 2755 non-travel patients for antibodies against spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and typhus group rickettsiae (TGR) using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (positive IgG titers ≥1:64). We classified cases using a sensitive surveillance case definition: confirmed (4-fold increase in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera with clinical evidence of infection), possible (single positive sera with clinical evidence) and previous rickettsial infection (single positive sera without clinical evidence). We classified cases seropositive for both SFGR and TGR as unspecified Rickettsia infections (URIs). Results Less than 5% of all patients had paired acute and convalescent sera tested, and of these, we found a single, laboratory-confirmed SFGR case, with a 4-fold increase in IgG titers and evidence of fever, maculopapular rash and headache. There were 45 possible (19 SFGR, 7 TGR, 19 URI) and 580 previous rickettsial infection (183 SFGR, 89 TGR, 308 URI) cases. The rate of positive tests for SFGR, TGR and URI combined (all case classifications) were 4.4 per 100,000 population. For confirmed and possible cases, the most common signs and symptoms were fever, headache, gastrointestinal complaints and maculopapular rash. The odds of having seropositive patients increased annually by 30% (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.23–1.39). Conclusions The rates of rickettsial infections in Ontario are difficult to determine. Based on confirmed and possible cases, rates are low, but inclusion of previous rickettsial infection cases would indicate higher rates. We highlight the need for education regarding the importance of testing acute and convalescent sera and consistent completion of the laboratory requisition in confirming rickettsial disease. We suggest further research in Ontario to investigate rickettsial agents in potential vectors and clinical studies employing PCR testing of clinical samples.']","['Nelder, Mark P., [Russell, Curtis B.], [Johnson, Steven], [Li, Ye], [Cronin, Kirby], [Warshawsky, Bryna], [Brandon, Nicholas], [Patel, Samir N.]']",['10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05244-8'],[''],"['Assessing human exposure to spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae in Ontario, Canada (2013–2018): a retrospective, cross-sectional study']"
"['Livestock are a major cornerstone for livelihoods of smallholders in the highlands of Ethiopia. However, infectious diseases are a key constraint in livestock production affecting productivity and food security. This study aimed to understand livestock producers’ perception on importance and epidemiology of livestock diseases. Participatory tools using focus group discussions were used to identify and rank livestock species, major livestock diseases, and their epidemiological patterns in smallholder systems. The study covered 17 districts in four regions, with two or three kebeles (smallest administrative unit) included in each district. To capture views of women and men, separate focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted. Data collected through proportional piling were used in generalized linear model analysis. Taking sheep as a reference, cattle were significantly the most preferred species with the odds of cattle scoring higher than sheep being 2.08 times ( P \u2009=\u20090.000). Sheep and poultry were equally the second most important livestock, followed by goat and equine. There were no statistically significant differences between men and women FGD groups and between the four regions in their preference for livestock species. Twelve out of 28 identified livestock diseases were mentioned by at least 10% of FGDs in their list of five most important diseases. Blackleg, foot, and mouth disease, lumpy skin disease, anthrax, and bovine pasteurellosis were ranked as the top five diseases by both men and women focus groups. Reasons for high scores included suddenness of death, zoonosis risks, animal age groups and species affected, frequency of occurrence, rate of transmission in herds, curability, and inefficient vaccination. Seasonality and agro-ecology were also factors associated with disease occurrence. The study also documents that adult men and women are more involved in activities related to disease transmission compared with other family members. When asked about impacts of diseases, loss of livelihood, displacement, and infection with zoonoses were mentioned, with women considered equally affected as men. In conclusion, participatory tools allowed understanding disease priorities of and their perceived epidemiology in smallholder systems. The perceptions and priorities of men and women are very similar, and both need to be involved in designing health management interventions. Based on the findings of this study, the intervention strategies listed in the 2013 animal health strategy of Ethiopia (MoA and ILRI 2013 ) seem pertinent and need to be implemented to overcome the challenges of diseases.']","['Gizaw, Solomon, [Desta, Hiwot], [Alemu, Biruk], [Tegegne, Azage], [Wieland, Barbara]']",['10.1007/s11250-019-02187-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02187-4'],[''],['Importance of livestock diseases identified using participatory epidemiology in the highlands of Ethiopia']

We describe flaviviruses that represent an established ongoing threat to global health and those that have recently emerged in new populations to cause significant disease. We also provide examples of lesser-known flaviviruses that circulate in restricted areas of the world but have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations. Finally, we discuss how an understanding of the epidemiology, biology, structure and immunity of flaviviruses can inform the rapid development of countermeasures to treat or prevent human infections as they emerge. Flaviviruses, a group of vector-borne RNA viruses that includes dengue virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus and several lesser-known species, often emerge in human populations and cause epidemics. Here, Pierson and Diamond review the basic biology of these viruses, their life cycles, the diseases they cause and available therapeutic options. They also discuss the global distribution of flaviviruses, with a focus on lesser-known species that have the potential to emerge more broadly in human populations.']","['Pierson, Theodore C., [Diamond, Michael S.]']",['10.1038/s41564-020-0714-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0714-0'],[''],['The continued threat of emerging flaviviruses']
"['Background Both incidence and geographical range of tick-borne disease has increased across the USA. Similar to people, dogs are hosts for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs also share our homes and beds, making them both a sentinel for the ticks in our backyards but also increasing our exposure to ticks. Measures to better track, prevent, and/or treat tick-borne diseases in companion animals can lead to better control and prevention of human tick-borne disease. This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA. Results Human patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely ( P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk ( P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely ( P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely ( P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp. Conclusions Tick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well.']","['Mahachi, Kurayi, [Kontowicz, Eric], [Anderson, Bryan], [Toepp, Angela J.], [Lima, Adam Leal], [Larson, Mandy], [Wilson, Geneva], [Grinnage-Pulley, Tara], [Bennett, Carolyne], [Ozanne, Marie], [Anderson, Michael], [Fowler, Hailie], [Parrish, Molly], [Saucier, Jill], [Tyrrell, Phyllis], [Palmer, Zachary], [Buch, Jesse], [Chandrashekar, Ramaswamy], [Scorza, Breanna], [Brown, Grant], [Oleson, Jacob J.], [Petersen, Christine A.]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-04118-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04118-x'],[''],['Predominant risk factors for tick-borne co-infections in hunting dogs from the USA']
"['Tick-borne diseases are a public health issue. To predict vector tick abundance and activity, it is necessary to understand the driving factors for these variables. In this study, the activity of Ixodes ricinus was investigated in forest and meadow habitats in Germany with a focus on abiotic factors. Ixodes ricinus adults, nymphs and larvae were caught by flagging over a period of 2\xa0years. Microclimatic and weather conditions were recorded at the collection sites. Statistical models were applied to describe correlations between abiotic factors and tick activity in univariable and multivariable analyses. Tick activity was observed in a broad range of air temperature between 3 and 28\xa0°C, and air humidity varied between 35 and 95%. In general, tick activity of nymphs and larvae was higher in forest habitats than that in meadows. With the exception of a single specimen of Dermacentor reticulatus , all ticks were Ixodes ricinus , most of them nymphs (63.2% in 2009 and 75.2% in 2010). For the latter, a negative binomial mixed-effects model fitted best to the observed parameters. The modelling results showed an activity optimum between 20 and 23\xa0°C for air temperature and between 13 and 15\xa0°C for ground temperature. In univariable analyses, the collection site, month, season, ground and air temperature were significant factors for the number of ticks caught and for all life stages. In the multivariable analysis, temperature, season and habitat turned out to be key drivers. Ixodes ricinus positive for RNA of tick-borne encephalitis virus was only found at a single sampling site.

We demonstrate that Lyme disease incidence is negatively correlated with mammalian biodiversity, the abundance of fried chicken restaurants and obesity rates. We argue, however, that these correlations are spurious, representing both an ‘ecologic fallacy’ and Simpson’s paradox, and are generated by the use of aggregated data.

Disrupting the LD transmission cycle in nature is a promising avenue for risk reduction. This experimental study evaluated the efficacy of fluralaner, a recent oral acaricide with a long duration of effect in dogs, for killing Ixodes scapularis ticks in Peromyscus maniculatus mice, a known wildlife reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi in nature. Methods We assigned 87 mice to 3 fluralaner treatment groups (50\xa0mg/kg, 12.5\xa0mg/kg and untreated control) administered as a single oral treatment. Mice were then infested with 20 Ixodes scapularis larvae at 2, 28 and 45\xa0days post-treatment and we measured efficacy as the proportion of infesting larvae that died within 48\xa0h. At each infestation, blood from 3 mice in each treatment group was tested to obtain fluralaner plasma concentrations (C p ). Results Treatment with 50\xa0mg/kg and 12.5\xa0mg/kg fluralaner killed 97% and 94% of infesting larvae 2\xa0days post-treatment, but no significant effect of treatment on feeding larvae was observed 28 and 45\xa0days post-treatment.

"['Background Understanding the drivers of Lyme disease incidence at broad spatial scales is critical for predicting and mitigating human disease risk. Previous studies have identified vector phenology and behavior, host community composition, and landscape features as drivers of variable Lyme disease risk. However, while the Lyme disease transmission cycles in the eastern and western USA involve different vector species ( Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus , respectively), the role of vector-specific differences in transmission efficiency has not been directly examined. By comparing the performance of traits involved in vector competence between these two species, this study aims to identify how vector competence contributes to variable Lyme disease risk. Methods We used a suite of laboratory experiments to compare the performance of traits related to vector competence for the two USA Lyme disease vectors. For each species, we measured the rate of attachment to a common rodent host, the engorgement weight, and the efficiency of pathogen acquisition (host to tick) and pathogen transmission (tick to host) from laboratory mice. In measuring pathogen acquisition and transmission, we used two different pathogen strains, one sympatric with I. scapularis and one sympatric with I. pacificus , to assess the importance of vector-pathogen coevolutionary history in transmission dynamics. Results We found I. pacificus had significantly higher host attachment success and engorgement weights, but significantly lower pathogen transmission efficiency relative to I. scapularis . Molting success and pathogen acquisition did not differ between these two species. However, pathogen acquisition efficiency was significantly higher for both sympatric vector and pathogen strains than the allopatric pairings. Conclusions This study identified species-specific vector traits as a potential driver of broad scale variation in Lyme disease risk in the USA. In particular, the exceedingly low rates of pathogen transmission from tick to host observed for I. pacificus may limit Lyme disease transmission efficiency in the western USA. Further, observed variation in pathogen acquisition between sympatric and allopatric vector-pathogen strains indicate that vector-pathogen coevolutionary history may play a key role in transmission dynamics. These findings underscore the need to consider vector traits and vector-pathogen coevolution as important factors governing regional Lyme disease risk.']","['Couper, Lisa I., [Yang, Youyun], [Yang, Xiaofeng Frank], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1186/s13071-020-3893-x'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3893-x'],[''],['Comparative vector competence of North American Lyme disease vectors']
"['Background Impact of climate change on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle in a given region depends on how the region-specific climate change patterns influence tick population development processes and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission dynamics involving both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes. Predicting the transmission risk of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with projected climate conditions is essential for planning public health interventions including vaccination programs to mitigate the TBE incidence in the inhabitants and travelers. We have previously developed and validated a mathematical model for retroactive analysis of weather fluctuation on TBE prevalence in Hungary, and we aim to show in this research that this model provides an effective tool for projecting TBEV transmission risk in the enzootic cycle. Methods Using the established model of TBEV transmission and the climate predictions of the Vas county in western Hungary in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, we quantify the risk of TBEV transmission using a series of summative indices - the basic reproduction number, the duration of infestation, the stage-specific tick densities, and the accumulated (tick) infections due to co-feeding transmission. We also measure the significance of co-feeding transmission by observing the cumulative number of new transmissions through the non-systemic transmission route. Results The transmission potential and the risk in the study site are expected to increase along with the increase of the temperature in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. This increase will be facilitated by the expected extension of the tick questing season and the increase of the numbers of susceptible ticks (larval and nymphal) and the number of infected nymphal ticks co-feeding on the same hosts, leading to compounded increase of infections through the non-systemic transmission. Conclusions The developed mathematical model provides an effective tool for predicting TBE prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle, by integrating climate projection with emerging knowledge about the region-specific tick ecological and pathogen enzootic processes (through model parametrization fitting to historical data). Model projects increasing co-feeding transmission and prevalence of TBEV in a recognized TBE endemic region, so human risk of TBEV infection is likely increasing unless public health interventions are enhanced.']","['Nah, Kyeongah, [Bede-Fazekas, Ákos], [Trájer, Attila János], [Wu, Jianhong]']",['10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4734-4'],[''],['The potential impact of climate change on the transmission risk of tick-borne encephalitis in Hungary']

In the phylogenetic analysis using gltA and ompA sequences of the detected Rickettsia , the highest sequence similarity was found with ‘ Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis’ isolate Xian-Hl-79, ‘ Ca . R. jingxinensis’ isolate F18, and ‘ Ca . R. longicornii‘ isolate ROK-HL727. In the microbiome study, Coxiella AB001519, a known tick symbiont, was detected in all 37 tick samples. Actinomycetospora chiangmaiensis was more abundant in Rickettsia -positive samples than in Rickettsia -negative samples. Conclusions In this study, iSeq\xa0100 was used to investigate the microbiome of H. longicornis , and the potentially pathogenic Rickettsia strain was detected in 16 out of 37 ticks. We believe that this approach will aid in large-scale pathogen screening of arthropods to be used in vector-borne disease control programs.

"['The main importance of ticks resides in their ability to harbor and transmit microorganisms that cause disease to animals and humans. In addition to pathogens, ticks coexist and interact with symbionts, and commensal bacteria that together form an ecological unit, the tick holobiont. The holobiont is an additional organismal level on which natural selection operates. The components of the tick hologenome, composed of host and microbiome genomes, are complimentary. In agreement with this proposition, antibiotic treatment produces disturbance of the tick-microbiota homeostasis which in turn decreases tick fitness and affects tick-pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that immune targeting of key members of the bacterial community of the tick microbiome by host antibodies could cause microbial dysbiosis with consequences for tick physiology and vector competence. Anti-tick microbiota vaccines were recently introduced as a tool to target the microbiota of vector arthropods by immunizing the vertebrate hosts against live keystone bacteria or tick microbiota bacterial proteins. This tool can also be used to target tick endosymbionts. Decreased abundance of selected keystone bacteria and/or endosymbionts may reshape the structure of tick microbial communities in a predictable manner. This tool can be used to manipulate the tick microbiome against ticks and transmitted pathogens. In this opinion, we explore the possibilities of this methodology for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.']","['Wu-Chuang, Alejandra, [Obregon, Dasiel], [Mateos-Hernández, Lourdes], [Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro]']",['10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-021-00818-6'],[''],['Anti-tick microbiota vaccines: how can this actually work?']
"['Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice ( Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats ( Neotoma fuscipes ) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus , the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens.']","['Salomon, Jordan, [Lawrence, Alexandra], [Crews, Arielle], [Sambado, Samantha], [Swei, Andrea]']",['10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04851-9'],[''],['Host infection and community composition predict vector burden']

"['Rapid spread of vector borne diseases, especially through mosquitoes is in alarming rise worldwide. Among mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti is a major vector transmitting arboviruses such as dengue and zika to human population. The ineffectiveness of control measures against these arboviruses has necessitated alternate strategies to curb disease transmission. Recent studies show that symbiotic bacteria from insects hinder pathogen transmission by altering vector competence. Therefore, analyzing the bacterial\xa0communities of mosquitoes is essential to identify potential bacteria that play a critical role in vector competence. Salivary gland, a key organ in viral transmission however, is minimally explored towards their microbiota. In this study, we have screened 28 bacterial isolates from salivary glands of non-blood fed (NBF) and blood fed (BF) female Ae. aegypti , collected from the field population of Coimbatore, India. Among them, 11 bacterial species from distinct genera belonging to three major phyla; Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Interestingly, the differences in bacterial species associated with salivary glands were clearly discernible.

"['Background Relapsing fever (RF) borreliae are arthropod-borne spirochetes and some of them cause human diseases, which are characterized by relapsing or recurring episodes of fever. Recently, it has been classified into two groups: soft tick-borne RF (STRF) borreliae and hard tick-borne RF (HTRF) borreliae. STRF borreliae include classical RF agents and HTRF borreliae, the latter of which include B. miyamotoi , a human pathogen recently identified in Eurasia and North America. Results In this study, we determined the genome sequences of 16 HTRF borreliae strains: 15 B. miyamotoi strains (9 from Hokkaido Island, Japan, 3 from Honshu Island, Japan, and 3 from Mongolia) and a Borrelia sp. tHM16w. Chromosomal gene synteny was highly conserved among the HTRF strains sequenced in this study, even though they were isolated from different geographic regions and different tick species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core gene sequences revealed that HTRF and STRF borreliae are clearly distinguishable, with each forming a monophyletic group in the RF borreliae lineage. Moreover, the evolutionary relationships of RF borreliae are consistent with the biological and ecological features of each RF borreliae sublineage and can explain the unique characteristics of Borrelia anserina . In addition, the pairwise genetic distances between HTRF borreliae strains were well correlated with those of vector species rather than with the geographical distances between strain isolation sites. This result suggests that the genetic diversification of HTRF borreliae is attributed to the speciation of vector ticks and that this relationship might be required for efficient transmission of HTRF borreliae within vector ticks. Conclusions The results of the present study, together with those from previous investigations, support the hypothesis that the common ancestor of borreliae was transmitted by hard-bodied ticks and that only STRF borreliae switched to using soft-bodied ticks as a vector, which was followed by the emergence of Borrelia recurrentis , lice-borne RF borreliae. Our study clarifies the phylogenetic relationships between RF borreliae, and the data obtained will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary history of RF borreliae.']","['Nakao, Ranna, [Kasama, Kentaro], [Boldbaatar, Bazartseren], [Ogura, Yoshitoshi], [Kawabata, Hiroki], [Toyoda, Atsushi], [Hayashi, Tetsuya], [Takano, Ai], [Maeda, Ken]']",['10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-021-01838-1'],[''],['The evolution of hard tick-borne relapsing fever borreliae is correlated with vector species rather than geographical distance']
"['Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii , which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus . Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii -infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii -infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival. A retrospective power analysis found that our sampling effort had sufficient power (>\u200980%) to detect small effects (differences of 5% to 10%) of our treatments.

"['Background The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities.

"['Background Spiroplasma is a widely distributed endosymbiont of insects, arthropods, and plants. In insects, Spiroplasma colonizes the gut, hemolymph, and reproductive organs of the host. Previous metagenomic surveys of the domesticated carmine cochineal Dactylopius coccus and the wild cochineal D. opuntiae reported sequences of Spiroplasma associated with these insects. However, there is no analysis of the genomic capabilities and the interaction of this Spiroplasma with Dactylopius. Results Here we present three Spiroplasma genomes independently recovered from metagenomes of adult males and females of D. coccus , from two different populations, as well as from adult females of D. opuntiae . Single-copy gene analysis showed that these genomes were\u2009>\u200992% complete. Phylogenomic analyses classified these genomes as new members of Spiroplasma ixodetis . Comparative genome analysis indicated that they exhibit fewer genes involved in amino acid and carbon catabolism compared to other spiroplasmas. Moreover, virulence factor-encoding genes (i.e., glpO , spaid and rip2 ) were found incomplete in these S. ixodetis genomes. We also detected an enrichment of genes encoding the type IV secretion system (T4SS) in S. ixodetis genomes of Dactylopius . A metratranscriptomic analysis of D. coccus showed that some of these T4SS genes (i.e., traG , virB 4 and virD 4) in addition to the superoxide dismutase sod A of S. ixodetis were overexpressed in the ovaries. Conclusion The symbiont S. ixodetis is a new member of the bacterial community of D. coccus and D. opuntiae . The recovery of incomplete virulence factor-encoding genes in S. ixodetis of Dactylopius suggests that this bacterium is a non-pathogenic symbiont. A high number of genes encoding the T4SS, in the S. ixodetis genomes and the overexpression of these genes in the ovary and hemolymph of the host suggest that S. ixodetis use the T4SS to interact with the Dactylopius cells. Moreover, the transcriptional differences of S. ixodetis among the gut, hemolymph and ovary tissues of D. coccus indicate that this bacterium can respond and adapt to the different conditions (e.g., oxidative stress) present within the host. All this evidence proposes that there is a strong interaction and molecular signaling in the symbiosis between S. ixodetis and the carmine cochineal Dactylopius .']","['Vera-Ponce León, Arturo, [Dominguez-Mirazo, Marian], [Bustamante-Brito, Rafael], [Higareda-Alvear, Víctor], [Rosenblueth, Mónica], [Martínez-Romero, Esperanza]']",['10.1186/s12864-021-07540-2'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07540-2'],[''],['Functional genomics of a Spiroplasma associated with the carmine cochineals Dactylopius coccus and Dactylopius opuntiae']

Here, we examined the bacterial microbiota hosted by the seabird soft tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae) in order to uncover bacterial interactions within ticks and how these interactions change over tick development. Bacterial communities were characterised through next-generation sequencing of the V3–V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial co-occurrence and co-exclusion were determined by analysing networks generated from the metagenomic data obtained at each life stage. Overall, the microbiota of O. maritimus was dominated by four bacterial genera, namely Coxiella , Rickettsia , Brevibacterium and Arsenophonus , representing almost 60% of the reads. Bacterial diversity increased over tick development, and adult male ticks showed higher diversity than did adult female ticks. Bacterial networks showed that co-occurrence was more frequent than co-exclusion and highlighted substantial shifts across tick life stages; interaction networks changed from one stage to the next with a steady increase in the number of interactions through development. Although many bacterial interactions appeared unstable across life stages, some were maintained throughout development and were found in both sexes, such as Coxiella and Arsenophonus. Our data support the existence of a few stable interactions in O. maritimus ticks, on top of which bacterial taxa accumulate from hosts and/or the environment during development. We propose that stable associations delineate core microbial interactions, which are likely to be responsible for key biological functions.']","['Gomard, Yann, [Flores, Olivier], [Vittecoq, Marion], [Blanchon, Thomas], [Toty, Céline], [Duron, Olivier], [Mavingui, Patrick], [Tortosa, Pablo], [McCoy, Karen D.]']",['10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01611-9'],[''],"['Changes in Bacterial Diversity, Composition and Interactions During the Development of the Seabird Tick Ornithodoros maritimus (Argasidae)']"

"['Background Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences.

"['Purpose A comprehensive systematic meta-analysis review which deals with the degrees and trends of human infestation by biological stages of ticks, the degrees and trends of human infestation by biological stages of ticks in rural and urban areas, the infestation scale of tick attachment sites in body parts of humans, and the degrees of tick infestation in human age groups is critical. Therefore, this systematic meta-analysis review summarizes the above-detailed human infestation spectrums about biological stages of hard ticks. Methods After a preliminary review from 605 papers representing areas of the study objectives, 96 were selected for detailed human infestation spectrums of biological stages of hard ticks. Results In general, the results suggest that the adult ticks, and mostly females attack humans more than larval and nymphalid ones, and adult males, respectively. Unlike the trends of human infestation by larval and nymphalid stages of ticks, and the adult, male and female ticks which exhibited approximately a sharply decreasing trend, the global trend of human infestation by hard ticks exhibited approximately a sharply increasing trend over time. Ticks attack humans more in rural area than urban area. Also, the trends of human tick infestation in rural and urban areas exhibit, respectively, a sharp increase and decrease trends over time. Conclusions The majority of ticks mostly attach to human body trunk and extremity than head and neck, and genital area.

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato\xa0(s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Methods Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2\xa0years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects\xa0models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Results We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2\xa0years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l.\xa0and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Conclusions Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.']","['Bregnard, Cindy, [Rais, Olivier], [Voordouw, Maarten Jeroen]']",['10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04646-0'],[''],['Masting by beech trees predicts the risk of Lyme disease']
"['Borrelia miyamotoi , a member of the tick-borne relapsing fever spirochetes, shows a serum-resistant phenotype in vitro. This ability of B. miyamotoi may contribute to bacterial evasion of the host innate immune system. To investigate the molecular mechanism of serum-resistance, we constructed a membrane protein-encoding gene library of B. miyamotoi using Borrelia garinii strain HT59G, which shows a transformable and serum-susceptible phenotype. By screening the library, we found that bom1093 and bom1515 of B. miyamotoi provided a serum-resistant phenotype to the recipient B. garinii . These B. miyamotoi genes are predicted to encode P35-like antigen genes and are conserved among relapsing fever borreliae. Functional analysis revealed that BOM1093 bound to serum vitronectin and that the C-terminal region of BOM1093 was involved in the vitronectin-binding property. Importantly, the B. garinii transformant was not serum-resistant when the C terminus-truncated BOM1093 was expressed. We also observed that the depletion of vitronectin from human serum enhances the bactericidal activity of BOM1093 expressing B. garinii , and the survival rate of BOM1093 expressing B. garinii in vitronectin-depleted serum is enhanced by the addition of purified vitronectin.

To evade the human host´s immune response, relapsing fever borreliae, including B. miyamotoi , produce distinct variable major proteins. Here, we investigated Vsp1, Vlp15/16, and Vlp18 all of which are currently being evaluated as antigens for the serodiagnosis of BMD. Comparative analyses identified Vlp15/16 but not Vsp1 and Vlp18 as a plasminogen-interacting protein of B. miyamotoi . Furthermore, Vlp15/16 bound plasminogen in a dose-dependent fashion with high affinity. Binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16 was significantly inhibited by the lysine analog tranexamic acid suggesting that the protein–protein interaction is mediated by lysine residues. By contrast, ionic strength did not have an effect on binding of plasminogen to Vlp15/16. Of relevance, plasminogen bound to the borrelial protein cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2251 upon conversion by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPa), demonstrating it retained its physiological activity. Interestingly, further analyses revealed a complement inhibitory activity of Vlp15/16 and Vlp18 on the alternative pathway by a Factor H-independent mechanism.

In host–parasite interactions, host phenology can affect parasite fitness due to the temporal constraints it imposes on host contact rates. However, it remains unclear how parasite transmission is shaped by the wide range of phenological patterns observed in nature. We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi . Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics. These results highlight the importance of phenology, a common driver of species interactions, for the fitness of a parasite.']","['MacDonald, Hannelore, [Akçay, Erol], [Brisson, Dustin]']",['10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00484-5'],[''],['The role of host phenology for parasite transmission']

"['Background The incidence of Lyme borreliosis varies over time and space through as yet incompletely understood mechanisms. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with a Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) genospecies, which is primarily transmitted by a bite of Ixodes ricinus nymphs. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in nymphal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (NIP), density of questing nymphs (DON) and the resulting density of infected nymphs (DIN). Methods We investigated the infection rates in I. ricinus nymphs that were collected monthly between 2009 and 2016 in 12 locations in the Netherlands. Using generalized linear mixed models, we explored how the NIP, DON and DIN varied during the seasons, between years and between locations. We also determined the genospecies of the Borrelia infections and investigated whether the genospecies composition differed between locations. Results The overall NIP was 14.7%. A seasonal pattern in infection prevalence was observed, with higher estimated prevalences in the summer than in the spring and autumn. This, combined with higher nymphal densities in summer, resulted in a pronounced summer peak in the estimated DIN. Over the 7.5-year study period, a significant decrease in infection prevalence was found, as well as a significant increase in nymphal density. These two effects appear to cancel each other out; the density of infected nymphs, which is the product of NIP × DON, showed no significant trend over years. Mean infection prevalence (NIP, averaged over all years and all months) varied considerably between locations, ranging from 5 to 26%. Borrelia genospecies composition differed between locations: in some locations almost all infections consisted of B. afzelii , whereas other locations had more diverse genospecies compositions. Conclusion In the Netherlands, the summer peak in DIN is a result of peaks in both NIP and DON. No significant trend in DIN was observed over the years of the study, and variations in DIN between locations were mostly a result of the variation in DON. There were considerable differences in acarological risk between areas in terms of infection prevalence and densities of ticks as well as in Borrelia genospecies composition.']","['Hartemink, Nienke, [Vliet, Arnold J.

We used observations submitted to the community science platform iNaturalist to assess predation and parasitism across urbanization gradients in a secretive, ‘hard-to-study’ species, the Southern Alligator Lizard ( Elgaria multicarinata ). From photographs, we quantified predation risk by assessing tail injuries and quantified parasitism by counting tick loads on lizards. We found that tail injuries increased with age and with urbanization, suggesting that urban areas are risky habitats. Conversely, parasitism decreased with urbanization likely due to a loss of hosts and anti-tick medications used on human companion animals. This community science approach generated a large dataset on a secretive species rapidly and at an immense spatial scale that facilitated quantitative measures of urbanization (e.g. percent impervious surface cover) as opposed to qualitative measures (e.g. urban vs. rural).

"['Abstract Parasites may impair host behavior in ways that reduce host fitness, especially when access to territories or mates becomes disrupted. Western fence lizards ( Sceloporus occidentalis ) are a key host to western blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus ). Males are highly aggressive during the mating season, competing with rivals through displays of color badges, pushups, and other behaviors. We hypothesized that experimental tick infestation diminishes the performance of male western fence lizards in intrasexual contests, via either blood loss, damage to sensory structures, or both. We infested adult males with larval ticks for 7 to 10 days, staged contests between infested and quality-matched control males, and measured their behavior in enclosure arenas. Infested lizards were less aggressive and exhibited decreased hematocrit, compared to non-infested animals. We found no relationships between aggression and either body size or blue ventral badge color traits, for either infested or uninfested males. There was also no effect of tick attachment location and hemoparasite infection on host contest behavior. This is the first demonstration of the impact of I. pacificus parasitism on intraspecific interactions of western fence lizards and suggests that tick infestation has substantial impacts on lizard fitness. Because I. pacificus rely heavily on these lizards for blood meals and dispersal, these impacts could also influence the abundance of ticks and the pathogens they vector. Significance statement Parasitism frequently impairs host behavior. We investigated the effect of blacklegged tick parasitism on western fence lizard contest behavior using a lab-based manipulation experiment. We demonstrated that tick infestation reduced lizard aggressiveness, which may lead to territory loss and reduced mating opportunities in the wild. We found no evidence that host body size or coloration\xa0are correlated with aggression.

Methods This study was conducted to detect B. burgdorferi in different tick vectors and animal hosts. Three hundred animals (dogs=100, cattle=100, and camels=100) were inspected for tick infestation. Blood samples from 160 tick-infested animals and their associated ticks ( n =1025) were collected and examined for the infection with B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The identified tick species were characterized molecularly by PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 region. Results The overall tick infestation rate among examined animals was 78.33% (235/300). The rate of infestation was significantly higher in camels (90%), followed by cattle (76%) and dogs (69%); ( P = 0.001).

The first cases of human infection with B. miyamotoi were identified in 2011. In the eastern USA, blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) become infected by feeding on an infected vertebrate host, or through transovarial transmission. We surveyed B. miyamotoi prevalence in ticks within forested habitats in Dutchess County, New York, and identified possible reservoir hosts. To assess spatial variation in infection, we collected questing nymphal ticks at >\xa0150 sites. To assess temporal variation in infection, we collected questing nymphs for 8 years at a single study site. We collected questing larval ticks from nine plots to estimate the amount of transovarial transmission. To evaluate potential reservoir hosts, we captured 14 species of mammal and bird hosts naturally infested with larval blacklegged ticks and held these hosts in the laboratory until ticks fed to repletion and molted to nymphs. We determined infection for all ticks using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The overall infection prevalence of questing nymphal ticks across all sites was ~\u20091%, but prevalence at individual sites was as high as 9.1%. We detected no significant increase in infection through time. Only 0.4% of questing larval ticks were infected. Ticks having fed as larvae from short-tailed shrews, red squirrels, and opossums tended to have higher infection prevalence than did ticks having fed on other hosts. Further studies of the role of hosts in transmission are warranted. The locally high prevalence of B. miyamotoi in the New York/New England landscape suggests the importance of vigilance by health practitioners and the public.']","['Keesing, F., [McHenry, D.

"['Cloth-dragging is the most widely-used method for collecting and counting ticks, but there are few studies of its reliability. By using cloth-dragging, we applied a replicated line transects survey method, in two areas in Sweden with different Ixodes ricinus tick-densities (low at Grimsö and high at Bogesund) to evaluate developmental stage specific repeatability, agreement and precision in estimates of tick abundance. ‘Repeatability’ was expressed as the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), ‘agreement’ with the Total Deviation Index (TDI) and ‘precision’ by the coefficient of variation (CV) for a given dragging distance. Repeatability (ICC) and agreement (TDI) were higher for the most abundant instar (nymphs) and in the area of higher abundance. At Bogesund tick counts were higher than at Grimsö and so also repeatability, with fair to substantial ICC estimates between 0.22 and 0.75, and TDI ranged between 1 and 44.5 counts of difference (thus high to moderate agreement). At Grimsö, ICC was poor to moderate and ranged between 0 and 0.59, whereas TDI remained low with estimates lower or equal to 1 count (thus high agreement). Despite a 100-fold lower abundance at Grimsö, the same level of precision for nymphs could be achieved with a 70% increase of dragging effort. We conclude that the cloth-dragging technique is useful for surveying ticks’ and primarily to estimate abundance of the nymphal stage, whereas it rarely will be recommended for larvae and adults.']","['Kjellander, Pia L., [Aronsson, Malin], [Bergvall, Ulrika A.], [Carrasco, Josep L.], [Christensson, Madeleine], [Lindgren, Per-Eric], [Åkesson, Mikael], [Kjellander, Petter]']",['10.1007/s10493-020-00565-4'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-020-00565-4'],[''],['Validating a common tick survey method: cloth-dragging and line transects']

"['Polyneuropathies encompass a broad array of etiologies, which vary by fiber size (small or large fiber), fiber type (somatic motor, somatic sensory, or autonomic), pattern of injury (axonal or demyelinating), distribution (length-dependent and length-independent), and rapidity of onset (acute, subacute, or chronic). Diabetes, B12 deficiency, alcohol, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and hereditary polyneuropathy or Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) represent common causes, and most often present in a length-dependent fashion. Less frequent causes should be considered in the setting of suggestive clinical findings per history and exam. In addition, plexopathies represent a unique subset of peripheral nerve injury. A detailed evaluation that encompasses symptoms, signs, and risk factors should complement a focused laboratory diagnostic workup in the approach to polyneuropathy and plexopathies. Electrodiagnostic evaluation is helpful to characterize large-fiber polyneuropathy severity and distribution, while intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density testing helps confirm small-fiber polyneuropathy. Carefully planned additional targeted testing includes imaging of nerve root, plexus, and nerve (particularly for plexopathies), sural nerve or fascicular nerve biopsy, CSF evaluation, and more targeted serologic testing. Clinicians should be attentive to the possibility of autoimmune, paraproteinemic, neoplastic, or vasculitic polyneuropathies, as immunotherapy or chemotherapy, when appropriate, should be instituted for such conditions in a timely fashion. Genetic polyneuropathies are becoming increasingly recognized, and some now have gene-directed therapies, such as transthyretin amyloidosis. Polyneuropathies due to toxins, drugs, or chemotherapies should be considered if there is a temporally linked onset at the time or shortly after the time of exposure to the onset of the polyneuropathy.']","['Feldman, Eva L., [Russell, James W.], [Löscher, Wolfgang N.], [Grisold, Wolfgang], [Meng, Stefan]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-63449-0_12'],['Chapter'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63449-0_12'],[''],['Polyneuropathies']
"['Ticks (Chelicerata, Ixodida) are blood-feeding ectoparasites believed to have evolved at least about 120 millions of years ago and found worldwide. However, many aspects of their unique life cycle and anatomy, including their mechanical properties, remain to be understood. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of the cuticle of the argasid tick Ornithodoros moubata to those of two species of ixodid tick, Amblyomma hebraeum and Ixodes pacificus that we explored in our earlier studies of the tick exoskeleton. Significant differences were expected given the substantial difference in life cycle, including a five-fold increase during the repeated adult blood meal for female O. moubata vs. 70- to 120-fold during the single feeding of the adult female A. hebraeum and I. pacificus . We demonstrate here that the layered structure and mechanical properties (stiffness and viscosity) of the cuticle show minor differences, but the difference in cuticle thickness is substantial. Ductility is lost during feeding; reduced pH restores ductility. Previous work suggests that this occurs in vivo in engorged ixodid ticks; there is no evidence of this occurring in vivo in O. moubata . Thinning of cuticle in O. moubata fed females is consistent with the predicted stretch of cuticle due to the blood meal; there is no evidence of cuticle synthesis during the short feeding period. Dimensional analysis suggests that the soft feel of argasid ticks is related to cuticle thickness, not cuticle stiffness. Relative to argasid ticks, the hard ixodid ticks accommodate a ca. 20-fold higher size of blood meal by starting with a thicker cuticle and growing much additional cuticle during engorgement.']","['Flynn, Peter C., [Forth, Jan Hendrik], [Kaufman, W.

"['Hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) act as important vectors of zoonotic pathogens. For instance, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes pose a severe health risk as aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis. Commonly, to study the abundance of questing (host-seeking) ticks, a 1 m 2 piece of cloth is dragged over vegetation for a determined distance. Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased.']","['Nyrhilä, Siiri, [Sormunen, Jani J.], [Mäkelä, Satu], [Sippola, Ella], [Vesterinen, Eero J.], [Klemola, Tero]']",['10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],['Article'],[''],['http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-020-00564-5'],[''],['One out of ten: low sampling efficiency of cloth dragging challenges abundance estimates of questing ticks']
